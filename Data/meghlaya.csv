The Elephant Falls are a two-tier waterfall in Shillong, Meghalaya, India.The mountain stream descends through two successive falls set in dells of fern-covered rocks.

The original Khasi name for the falls is Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew, which translates to the three-step waterfall.This name is still used locally. However, the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall.The name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock that looked like an elephant near the fall. This rock was destroyed in the 1897 due to an earthquake.",a week ago,2024-12-10T05:53:44,,,null,0,533,2285,1,null,null

The cascading waterfalls, surrounded by lush greenery, create a breathtakingly picturesque setting. The falls are divided into three levels, and a well-maintained staircase allows visitors to explore each tier comfortably.

The sound of the water rushing over the rocks is soothing, and the clean, fresh air adds to the experience. There are plenty of photo opportunities at every level, making it a paradise for photography enthusiasts.

The site is well-managed, with parking facilities, restrooms, and a few shops nearby selling souvenirs and refreshments. The entry fee is nominal, and the path is safe, though a bit steep in parts, so comfortable footwear is recommended.

Overall, Elephant Falls is a gem in Meghalaya that showcases the region's natural beauty and charm. It's perfect for a short visit and offers a tranquil break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Highly recommended for all visitors to Shillong!

The place is very neat and clean with several souvenir shops outside the gate which sell a variety of items to take home. The first falls is just a small climb and can be viewed by everyone. The second falls are a few more steps down and more like a hidden fall. The third and last falls requires one to climb down steeper steps and is where the falls end. It is a bit difficult to climb up but still comparatively easier than other falls in the region. There was lot of water in the falls and is a must visit place if you are in Shillong.

The cascading water is mesmerizing, and the sound of the falls creates a calming atmosphere. The lush greenery surrounding the falls adds to its beauty, making it a perfect spot for nature lovers. The walk down to the falls is a bit steep, but its totally worth it once you reach the bottom. The sight of the water crashing down is just stunning, especially with the sunlight filtering through the trees. Its a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature.

Named by the British after a nearby rock that resembled an elephant (which was later destroyed in an earthquake), the falls are known locally as Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew, meaning The Three Step Waterfalls, because it flows down in three distinct cascades. Surrounded by lush greenery and dense forests, the waterfall offers a serene and refreshing escape from the city. The first cascade is broad and relatively gentle, while the second is narrower and flows through jagged rocks, and the final tier plunges dramatically into a shallow pool below. A well-maintained trail with steps and viewing platforms allows visitors to easily explore each tier, making the falls both accessible and enjoyable. The best time to visit is during or just after the monsoon season (June to September), when the falls are at their fullest, though the cool climate of Shillong makes it a pleasant destination year-round. With its scenic beauty and close proximity to the city, Elephant Falls is a must-visit spot for tourists, nature lovers, and photographers exploring the landscapes of Meghalaya.

It is nearly 12 km away from the Shilling center point. This includes Shillong local sightseeing.Entry ticket fare is Rs-100.The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a Horsetail-waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes into view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.

Elephant Falls in Meghalaya is an absolute must-visit for nature lovers. Located just a short drive from Shillong, this majestic three-tiered waterfall is nestled amidst lush greenery, creating a peaceful and scenic ambiance. Each level of the falls offers a unique perspective, with the final tier being the most impressive as the water cascades down the rocks with force and grace.

What truly sets Elephant Falls apart is the serenity of the area. Despite being a popular tourist spot, the surroundings feel calm and relatively untouched. The path leading to the falls is well-maintained, making it easy for visitors of all ages to navigate. There are plenty of spots to sit and take in the breathtaking view, and the cool mist from the waterfall is refreshing, especially on a warm day.

The name Elephant Falls comes from a rock formation that once resembled an elephant but was unfortunately destroyed by an earthquake. However, the falls still retain their charm and allure. I highly recommend visiting in the early morning or late afternoon when the light enhances the natural beauty.

Overall, Elephant Falls offers an unforgettable experience, blending natural beauty, tranquility, and a sense of adventure. Perfect for photography enthusiasts, couples, or families looking to reconnect with nature. Dont forget to stop by the small market at the entrance for some local souvenirs.",2 months ago,2024-10-17T05:54:00,,,null,0,74,300,1,null,null

It can be called as your first waterfall of your Meghalaya Trip. 2 views are easily accessible but for the 3rd view or you can say to reach the bottom of the fall, you have to travel through around 40-50 steep staircases which might be problematic for older people. Nevertheless, once you reach the bottom, you cannot leave the place without being mesmerised of the beauty it holds. It is a must to visit place. Theres a nominal entry fees. Also theres a small market area around it so you can shop some souvenirs. Washroom area is also clean.

ChIJVfNVS0OHUDcRkI3aTsUkW0s,"Elephant Falls, Shillong",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURueXItYUJnEAE,Debasish Debnath,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115302081332457346819/reviews?entry=ttu,5,"The city of ice of the state of cloud ,full of tourist attraction in North Eastern region Shillong is the queen of beauty and present environment also.
Our world famous poet Rabindranath Tagore many times came here. Many eminent personalies often come here to see its charms .
But last month while I visited found new changes there.
In this month of September the city, which would be under 12 degree temperature minimum nowadays increased to 21 degree or above .
Similarly max which was 23 , now it become 32 or above.
In shiling previously no where there were any option of celling Fan option. But now Fans are seen many places and company Distributors of celling Fan already open their business in the city.
Local fruits are not available like that time but fruit sellers find more profit by transporting / importing fruit from kashmir.
Great changes are observed in Shilong.
Global warming plays an important role regarding such changes.
The issues regarding local youths fresh and spontaneous lifestyle and soft personality was remaining same where as most important Blessing of Megalaya as I think is Natural Stone and the Natiinal Highway from Shillong to Guwahati.
These two may be the  Blessings of Meghalaya .
Because suppose to o construction boundary wall other than that state we need 2000 nos Brick @ Rs 20.00/ each @Total Rs 40000 along with Transportaton cost of Rs 3000, which in total cones around Rs. 43000.00
The state Meghalaya is saving such amount in a single issue means they are generating Money in other terms .
The National Highway is also a gift for local people because many tourist travellerz often follow this only road to visit both the sate.
Local youth by registering car permit and a car loan of 5 lakh could easily avail profit with in 5 months @ ammount =Rs (25x4000x5)= Rs 500000.00 considering operation of 25 days monthly with daily turnover of Rs 4000 excluding all others expenses.
Now if any person work 5 years in such line he could gain atlest Rs Half core .
So Nstural climate , National highway connecting both nearby twin city with Natural Stone are the  Natural gift by blessings of Meghalaya. Economics is calculated based on these parameter.
Now where there is no such availability surely have to search workability or any other sector of earning atleast.
Various swabalamban scheme by state/ central where youths are given free training followed by financial business loan can have bright future in a) Piggary, b) Poultry farm c) Cow milk business d) Fishery e) Transport business specially carrying commercial ..etc with proper insurance could have a great chance to make a profitable turnover per month @ Rs. 75000-100000 per person at minimum condition of nominal qualification and experience with ability. Higher quality has their own way of higher source of job/ business / Enterprise..as per their norms naturally. But
Need self motivation and self enthusiasm by surrendering any bad ego or . Job or alike functions is being necessitates in todays time .
Because due to fast automation of digitized methodology with advanced technology of minimum. Manpower with cost effective policy job creator and job seekers are now becoming slimed .
So individual self sufficient earning on self Product could be able to enhance ones own economic development and which in tern can make society more economy full through development. This perhaps will be prime mantra in developing future economics in many areas. Thanks.",2 months ago,2024-10-17T05:54:03,,,null,0,5,7,,null,null

To visit, you need to purchase an entrance ticket, which costs around 100 rupees. There is a parking area available free of charge, where you can leave your vehicle. At the entrance, you also have the opportunity to wear the traditional Khasi dress, a unique experience reflecting the local culture.

The first waterfall greets you with its beauty, and as you continue, youll come across the second and third waterfalls, connected by a scenic bridge. After exploring the waterfalls, you can relax in a nearby park, making it a complete experience. However, one downside is that visitors are charged an additional ticket fee at one point within the area, which some find disappointing.

Its important to note that there are no food options available inside the waterfall area, so its best to grab a meal outside before your visit. Restrooms are available on-site for convenience. Overall, Elephant Falls is a beautiful and refreshing destination that offers a memorable experience for nature lovers.",3 months ago,2024-09-17T05:54:08,,,null,0,62,188,1,null,null

But being a nature spot and a great viewpoint with such a large waterfall makes the place exceptional from the others and one should visit the place once to exprience its beauty within nature.

The seating arrangement near the first fall is excellent, providing a comfortable spot to sit and enjoy the beautiful view. Its easily accessible and perfect for elders who might want to avoid the more strenuous paths.

However, I wouldnt recommend going to the other falls if you have mobility issues, as the paths can be quite steep and challenging. The first fall is stunning and offers a great experience on its own, making it a must-visit if youre in the area. Overall, Elephant Falls is a beautiful spot to enjoy nature and relax.

Nestled in the heart of Meghalaya, this three-tiered waterfall is a visual and auditory delight. Each tier has its own unique charm, and the cascades create a mesmerizing spectacle. The first fall is broad and gentle, the second is more rugged and dramatic, and the third tier is the most impressive, with water gushing down with incredible force.

The path to the falls is well-maintained, and there are plenty of viewpoints where you can stop to take in the beauty and snap some amazing photos. The lush greenery surrounding the falls adds to the serene atmosphere, making it a perfect spot for nature lovers.

What I particularly appreciated was the ease of access. The steps are manageable, even for those who might not be in peak physical condition, and there are resting spots along the way. Theres also a small souvenir shop near the entrance where you can pick up some local crafts.

Parking is convenient, and the area is clean and well-kept. The best time to visit is during the monsoon season when the falls are at their most powerful and the surroundings are lush and vibrant.

Overall, Elephant Falls is a must-visit when in Shillong. Whether youre a solo traveler, a couple, or with family, the experience is refreshing and rejuvenating. Highly recommended!

It has three parts...called the First Fall, Second Fall and Third Fall...here Im giving the First and Third Falls picture...but believe me these pictures are not good enough to tell the beauty and vibe of this place...

It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the region, known for its natural beauty and serene environment. Here are some key details about Elephant Falls.

Key Features of Elephant Falls

1. **Name and Origin**:
- The name Elephant Falls was given by British colonists because a rock at the base of the falls resembled an elephant. Unfortunately, this rock was destroyed in an earthquake in 1897.
- Locally, the falls are known as Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew, which means The Three Step Waterfalls in the Khasi language, referring to the three distinct sections of the falls.

2. **Structure and Appearance**:
- The waterfall consists of three segments, each falling from a different height, creating a stunning visual effect.
- The first part of the fall is broad and plunges into a small pool, the second part is hidden between the dense vegetation and rock structures, and the third part is the most visible and awe-inspiring as it cascades down the rocks.

3. **Scenic Beauty**:
- The surrounding area is lush with greenery, with dense forests and various plant species, contributing to the tranquil and picturesque setting.
- The falls are particularly impressive during the monsoon season when the water flow is at its peak.

4. **Tourist Facilities**:
- There are well-maintained footpaths and steps leading to different viewing points, allowing visitors to experience the falls from various angles.
- The site is equipped with rest areas, benches, and viewing platforms to enhance the visitor experience.

5. **Accessibility**:
- Elephant Falls is located approximately 12 kilometers from Shillong, making it easily accessible by road. Visitors can hire taxis, take buses, or drive to the site.
- The falls are open throughout the year, but the best time to visit is during the post-monsoon season (September to November) when the water flow is optimal and the surroundings are lush green.

6. **Nearby Attractions**:
- Visitors often combine their trip to Elephant Falls with visits to other nearby attractions such as Shillong Peak, Ward's Lake, and the Don Bosco Museum.

### Visiting Information

- **Timings**: The falls are typically open to visitors from early morning to late afternoon. It is advisable to check the exact timings before planning a visit.
- **Entry Fee**: A nominal entry fee is usually charged for access to the falls, which goes towards the maintenance of the site.
- **Safety**: While the paths and viewing platforms are generally safe, it is important for visitors to wear comfortable shoes and be cautious, especially during the rainy season when the paths can be slippery.

### Conclusion

Elephant Falls in Shillong is a must-visit destination for nature lovers and those seeking a peaceful retreat amidst natural beauty. Its unique three-step structure, lush surroundings, and easy accessibility make it a favorite spot for tourists visiting Meghalaya.

This name is still used locally. However the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall. The name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock that looked like an elephant near the fall. This rock was destroyed in 1897 due to an earthquake.
Elephant Falls is situated at the outskirts of the main city of Shillong in the East Khasi Hills District, Upper Shillong. It is almost 12 km away from the Shillong city center.

It is surrounded by lush greenery, making it a popular spot for nature lovers and photographers. We tried local traditional clothes and the experience was awesome. The best time to visit is during the monsoon season when the falls are at their most impressive, with the water flow at its peak.

This rock was destroyed in 1897 due to an earthquake.

The falls are surrounded by beautiful green trees and undulating hills that drop from a height of roughly 30 meters.The breathtaking Elephant falls were referred to as Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew by the local Khasi people, which means The Three Step Waterfalls, as these falls consist of three mesmerising falls in succession.

A ticket costing 20 INR is required to view the fall with an additional charge of 20 INR for permission to bring the camera. (Variable)

Named by the British for an elephant-shaped rock near the falls, which has since disintegrated, the site consists of three distinct cascades, each offering its unique charm. The first fall is broad and hidden among trees, the second is more tamed and shallow, and the third and most spectacular is a fast-flowing drop over sharp rocks. The surrounding lush greenery and well-maintained pathways make for a pleasant and accessible visit. There are viewing platforms and steps that provide close-up views and photo opportunities of the cascading water. The falls are particularly impressive during the monsoon season when they are at their fullest. Elephant Falls provides a serene and refreshing escape, making it a must-visit for nature enthusiasts and tourists exploring the beauty of Meghalaya.",6 months ago,2024-06-17T05:54:45,,,null,0,540,13205,1,null,null

The entry fee was 100/- per person but it was not at all worth it. There was hardly any water. The place is not well maintained. May be 1st week of May wasn't the best time to visit the place. But I would recommend visiting other waterfalls and skip this one!

As you stroll through the lush greenery, the sound of cascading water fills the air, creating a serene atmosphere. The falls, named after a rock formation resembling an elephant, offer a mesmerizing sight.
Visitors can get up close to the falls and feel the refreshing spray of water. The surrounding landscape is picturesque, perfect for capturing memorable moments.
However, accessibility might be a challenge for some, as there are stairs to navigate.

Overall, Elephant Falls is a must-visit destination when you are in Shillong.

Unlike the awe-inspiring remoteness of Nohkalikai Falls, Elephant Falls offers a chance to get up close and personal with its cascading beauty.

The journey itself is delightful. Imagine a gentle walk through verdant foliage, sunlight dappling the path, and the sound of cascading water growing steadily louder. As you arrive, the first tier of the falls unfolds before you - a broad curtain of water gushing down moss-covered rocks. The air is cool and refreshing, carrying a fine mist that dances on your skin.

The true magic lies in exploring further. Unlike Nohkalikais distant grandeur, Elephant Falls allows you to descend (with caution!) along well-maintained steps. Each tier reveals a different character - the first, a powerful cascade, the second, a series of delicate streams, and the final one, the crown jewel. The third tier is the most impressive, with water cascading down a sheer rock face, creating a mesmerizing scene.

The sound of the falls is a symphony in itself. It drowns out the everyday noise, leaving you with a sense of tranquility. Take a moment to sit on a nearby rock, breathe in the fresh air, and let the cascading water wash away your worries.

While not the tallest or most dramatic waterfall, Elephant Falls holds a special charm. Its a place to reconnect with nature, create lasting memories, and capture the beauty on camera (or simply in your minds eye)

Also there is a price of 100/- on the ticket for which it is totally not worth. The waterfall is good looking, but nothing mesmerising about it. Rather visit krang shuri or chirapunji. If the intention is to visit sites in Shillong, shillong peak(@ 60/- per person and 200 per cab of 3), laitlum canyon , wards lake and umiam lake are worth the time efforts and money. We missed wards lake as we lost time visiting this place.
There are steps which need to be climbed down. The steps to the first level fall is relatively easy, the second and third falls ,you need to climb down some steeper steps which might be difficult for senior citizens to climb back up . So unless you have 2 days at least on hand , dont bother visiting elephant falls

Due to my physical condition, I could go only upto 1st step, which is only about 60-70 steps.
The tourist amenities are really good, not only at this place, but all over Meghalaya, Cherapunji, everywhere you will find clean toilet with western style toilets, soap dispenser, water availability, and of course, food.
Nice quality food, tea, cold drinks etc, and very large area of parking, where at least 100 vehicles can park.
The scenery at Elephant Falls was good, but, in rainy season with so much water, you will not want to leave the place. Its mesmerizing.
Highly recommended.

Price is a bit high for what it is, a very short trail across and down the waterfall. No where else to walk and nothing else to see, so it's a very short visit and quick photo. Personally, I would prefer to go on a hike and see a less touristy waterfall but this one is good for people with health problems and kids etc. who want to see a waterfall but can't walk very far :-)

Even falls is maintained well by the authorities by keeping plastics away. Strictly people will not allow you to swim/ play around the falls, which is kind of good initiative towards keeping the falls clean and safe.

Other than that, fabulous waterfalls. Beautiful.

It can be covered during the Shillong local tour. Keep in mind, do not follow what your hired tour vehicle says of showing you places around Shillong. There aren't much to see IN Shillong. Make them include laitlum canyon in for the same price, or maybe, 10% extra while omitting the places you wouldn't want to visit.

Coming to this waterfalls, it can be seen from another park but no point in going there if you can see it from here, up close and personal. ;)

There aren't too many steps. Couch potatoes and unfit people will tell you there's a lot. Kudos to the fit and regular exercise people.
You'll have to go down and up approximately a 5-7 storey building stairs length. So, less than moderate workout. First you'll reach the First falls. On the way to it, there are areas where you can get your picture taken in a traditional Khasi dress. 150 as of February 2024 for that.

After the first falls, descending starts. That's the main part. Easy to go up or down the stairs. Cement stairs.

The base of the falls, there's a rope which you aren't allowed to cross. No swimming allowed.

Enjoy your descent and ascent. DO NOT DIRTY OR LITTER THE PLACE. Enjoy Meghalaya. Happy trip. :)

The journey to the end involves numerous stairs, which might be challenging for older individuals.

At the entry point, there are a couple of shops offering local items, adding a cultural touch to the visit.

Additionally, there are convenient amenities like restaurants and washrooms available nearby, enhancing the overall visitor experience.

In summary, Elephant Falls is a must-visit for nature enthusiasts, offering both natural beauty and accessibility to facilities for a comfortable visit.

It is a tourists paradise with three layers of falls. The Britishers named this fall so owing to the presence of an elephant-shaped rock on one side of the fall. However, the stone was destroyed due to an earthquake in 1897. Elephant Waterfalls is a superb place for spending some time in the midst of nature.
The Elephant falls were referred to as Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew by the local Khasi people, which means The Three Step Waterfalls, as these falls consist of three mesmerising falls in succession. Elephant Falls is a great stopover destination before one heads for further journeys into Meghalaya. Located 12 km away from the capital city of Shillong.

Tucked away in the lush green landscapes, this natural wonder is a testament to the breathtaking beauty that Mother Nature can create.

The journey to the falls is an adventure in itself, with scenic trails surrounded by dense foliage. Once you reach the falls, the thunderous sound of cascading water and the misty spray in the air create a mesmerizing atmosphere. The sight of the water gracefully flowing down the rocks is nothing short of spectacular.

The well-maintained pathways and viewing platforms make it easy to explore the area and capture the perfect photo. The lush greenery and vibrant flora surrounding Elephant Falls make it a photographers paradise. Dont forget your camera!

I was impressed by the efforts made to preserve the natural environment. There are informative signs about the local flora and fauna, raising awareness about the importance of conservation. Its heartening to see a destination that values its ecological heritage.

For adventure seekers, there are opportunities to venture closer to the falls and feel the invigorating spray of water. However, safety measures are in place, ensuring a thrilling yet secure experience.

Whether youre a nature enthusiast, a photographer, or just someone seeking a peaceful retreat, Elephant Falls is a must-visit destination. Its a perfect blend of natural beauty, tranquility, and a sense of awe that stays with you long after you leave. I highly recommend adding Elephant Falls to your itinerary - its a nature lovers paradise!

Nice place, the waterfall can be seen in three steps.
The parking is surrounded by small shops. Sadly, you cant jump into the waterfall, but its still enjoyable. Great for a stroll and checking out winter clothing stores. Overall, a lovely spot with a minor letdown.

After the first waterfall there are steps to reach the remaining 2 waterfalls.
There is also a small park near the entrance for children to play.

Elephant Falls in Shillong is nothing short of a natural masterpiece that leaves visitors enchanted and awe-inspired. Nestled amidst the lush landscapes of Meghalaya, this iconic waterfall is a must-visit for anyone exploring the enchanting Northeast of India.

From the moment you set foot in the Elephant Falls Park, you are greeted by the soothing sounds of cascading water and the refreshing scent of nature. The well-maintained pathways and greenery surrounding the area add to the overall charm of the place. As a nature enthusiast, I was thrilled to explore this haven of tranquility.

The journey to the main waterfall is an adventure in itself. The pathway leading to Elephant Falls is lined with vibrant flora, and the gentle murmur of the stream accompanies you as you stroll along. The anticipation builds with every step, and as you turn a corner, the majestic Elephant Falls comes into view.

The first tier of the falls, named Wei Iaplam, is a sight to behold. The water plunges down from a rocky outcrop, creating a mesmerizing display of natural beauty. The sheer force and intensity of the water, coupled with the surrounding greenery, make for a picturesque setting. Its the perfect spot for photographers looking to capture the raw power of nature.

A short trek further upstream leads you to the second tier, Wei Iapoh, which is equally captivating. Here, the water gracefully flows over a series of rocks, creating small pools that reflect the sunlight in a dazzling dance of colors. The serenity of this spot makes it an ideal place for those seeking a peaceful retreat.

What sets Elephant Falls apart is its unique rock formations and the way the water weaves its way through the landscape. The rocks, covered in moss and ferns, add a touch of mystique to the entire setting. Visitors can get up close to feel the cool spray of water on their faces, making the experience immersive and refreshing.

The park authorities have done an excellent job of providing well-maintained viewing platforms and seating areas, allowing visitors to relax and soak in the breathtaking scenery. Additionally, informative signboards share interesting facts about the falls, enhancing the educational aspect of the visit.

I recommend visiting Elephant Falls during the monsoon season when the waterfall is at its most robust and the surrounding greenery is at its peak. However, the falls maintain their charm throughout the year, making it a year-round destination for nature enthusiasts.

In conclusion, Elephant Falls in Shillong is a testament to the unspoiled beauty of Meghalaya. Whether youre a nature lover, a photographer, or simply someone seeking a peaceful escape, this waterfall is a must-visit destination. I left Elephant Falls with a heart full of memories and a deep appreciation for the wonders of the natural world.",11 months ago,2024-01-17T05:55:26,,,null,1,37,182,1,null,null

The area is covered with greenery.
Water level will be low during the winter season and its recommended to visit during monsoon.

One has to climb down to get the 3rd one.
Takes around 5-6mins for adults.
Seniors and elders may avoid this place as there are many stairs and its slippery during and after rain.

Ample parking space is available and entry fees is 100 INR per person.
Recommended for those who like exploring and enjoy being with nature.

Its close to the Air Force Museum and easily reachable.

The falls and the walkways are well laid out and are relatively easy for all to navigate.

We saw the falls in the summer and the water flow wasnt much. Itll be great after the rains pick up.

The parking is ample, with well laid out shops and a toilet. The entry fee is Rs. 100/ person with or without vehicle.

A good and easy location to see a waterfall at Shillong .

However the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall.[4] The name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock that looked like an elephant near the fall. This rock was destroyed in the 1897 due to an earthquake.. wiki

Its a wonderful site to behold... three waterfalls in one go... entry fee is 100 per head and thats ok enough as it goes towards the upkeep of the site.
There are stalls at the entrance where you will get food and other items and souvenirs.. but the cost is a bit on the higher side .. even for a bottle of water you have to pay double the MRP.
The site is thronged by visitors almost throughout the year..
You need to go a good number of stairs to see all the three falls but thats worthwhile so far as you are not unfit to climb back the stairs.
The sound of the water is mesmerizing and nature flows in full bounty here.

It is hardly 11kms from the heart of the shillong city and the road too is a site to relish with greeneries all around and pine trees embracing you enroute.

It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the region and offers a breathtaking sight to behold. The falls derive their name from a rock resembling an elephant near the foot of the waterfall. With its mesmerizing beauty and natural charm, Elephant Falls has become a must-visit destination for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts.

The waterfall is formed by three successive falls that cascade down from a height of approximately 100 feet. The first fall is the widest and most powerful, creating a thunderous roar as the water crashes onto the rocks below. The second fall is smaller but equally captivating, while the third fall is hidden amidst dense foliage, adding an element of mystery to the overall experience.

The surrounding landscape of Elephant Falls is nothing short of enchanting. Lush greenery, towering trees, and vibrant flora create a picturesque backdrop against which the falls stand out in all their glory. Visitors can take leisurely walks along well-maintained pathways that lead to different viewpoints, allowing them to capture stunning photographs and immerse themselves in the tranquility of nature.

One of the highlights of visiting Elephant Falls is the opportunity to witness the sheer power and force of nature up close. The thundering sound of water hitting the rocks, combined with the misty spray that fills the air, creates a truly immersive experience for visitors. It is advisable to carry raincoats or umbrellas as the spray from the falls can be quite intense at times.

Apart from its natural beauty, Elephant Falls also holds historical significance. It was originally named Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew by the local Khasi people, which translates to Three Steps Waterfalls. During British colonial rule, it was renamed Elephant Falls due to the presence of a rock formation resembling an elephant near its base.

To enhance visitors experience, the local authorities have developed well-maintained viewpoints, bridges, and staircases that allow easy access to different parts of the falls. There are also seating areas and picnic spots where visitors can relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

In conclusion, Elephant Falls in Shillong, Meghalaya is a natural wonder that captivates all who visit. Its powerful cascades, lush surroundings, and historical significance make it a must-see attraction for anyone traveling to the region. Whether you are an adventure seeker or simply appreciate the beauty of nature, Elephant Falls is sure to leave a lasting impression.",a year ago,2023-12-17T05:55:59,,,null,0,91,446,1,null,null

It is named after an elephant-shaped rock. The waterfall consists of three levels, each with a different shape and height. The first level is broad and hidden among trees, the second level is narrow and domesticated, and the third level is the tallest and most spectacular, with clear water falling over sharp rocks. Elephant Falls is a popular tourist attraction that offers scenic views, refreshing water, and souvenir shops. It is situated 12 km away from the city center and can be reached by a railed walkway that descends along the face of the waterfall.

The falls are named after an elephant-shaped rock near the waterfall. My journey to Elephant Falls began with a short trek through the lush green forest.

As I reached the falls, I was mesmerized by the beauty of the cascading waterfalls. The sound of the water falling from a height echoed through the valley. I spent some time admiring the falls and taking pictures. The cool breeze and the mist from the waterfall made it a refreshing experience.

The experience at Elephant Falls was unforgettable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Shillong.

There are 3 parts of this fall and you need to trek to see all three parts. Amazing view everywhere and the sound of water is mesmerising. You need to pay for ticketa before entering to the waterfall. There are some restaurents also near the fall. Try to visit in monsoon to have more water level.

The waterfalls were mesmerising. The water flow was great and with the lush greenery that was around the place and the white water made the place look even better. The water was very clean and you get to see three parts of the water fall when you visit this place. My pro tip would be visiting it during the rainy season because that's the time when the water falls is in full bloom.,a year ago,2023-12-17T05:56:29,,,null,1,229,1165,1,null,null

Walking down the stairs are worthfull to experience the fall. Just sit there and hear the sound of water, its a serene experience.
Kids friendly as they enjoyed playing in water, elders need to be around to keep an eye on as balancing on rocks can be tricky at times.
Must carry umbrella and raincoats if you travel to Meghalaya especially during summer and monsoon seasons.
The shops do rent umbrellas at reasonable price. We got it at INR 30 for each.

This rock was destroyed in the 1897 due to an earthquake. To reach the falls, you have to climb 150 steps which would be a little slippery. You will find a few benches along the way for you to sit and relax. Elephant Falls is also referred to as The Three Step Waterfall as you will see three different parts of falls there.

The falls are surrounded by lush greenery and offer a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. The cascading waterfalls are a sight to behold, and visitors can enjoy a refreshing swim in the natural pool at the bottom of the falls. However, it is important to be cautious while swimming as the water can be deep and the currents strong. Overall, Elephant Falls is a beautiful destination that should not be missed when visiting Meghalaya.

The natural beauty of this majestic waterfall left me mesmerized. As I approached, the sight of water cascading down the rocks was truly breathtaking. The surrounding lush greenery and the peaceful ambiance added to the enchantment. The crystal-clear water sparkled under the sunlight, creating a picturesque scene. I couldnt resist immersing myself in its refreshing waters, feeling the spray on my skin. The sound of rushing water was both soothing and invigorating. Elephant Fall is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a slice of natures tranquility and pure beauty.

The entrance area is also very attractive and clean. When I went to the end of April, the water flow was low, but it didnt take away from its beauty. The stairs leading down to the falls are well-maintained, and its easy for anyone, including older people, to go down and enjoy the stunning view. The whole experience was amazing, and I was impressed by how clean and well-kept the place was. Just keep in mind that the water levels can vary, so its good to check before you go. Overall, Elephant Falls is a must-see destination with its unique beauty and cleanliness.

The falls consist of three tiers, each with its own distinctive beauty and character.

The first tier of the falls is easily accessible and offers a stunning view of the cascading water as it tumbles down a rocky cliff. The second tier can be reached via a short hike and offers a more secluded and peaceful setting, surrounded by dense forest and lush greenery.

The third tier of the falls is the highest and most spectacular, offering a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. Visitors can hike up to the top of the falls, taking in the stunning views and enjoying the sound of the rushing water.

In addition to the falls themselves, Elephant Falls is also home to a beautiful park, complete with manicured gardens, walking paths, and scenic overlooks. Visitors can relax and take in the beauty of the park, while enjoying a picnic or simply soaking up the tranquil atmosphere.

Overall, Elephant Falls is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking natural beauty and tranquility. The falls and surrounding park offer a peaceful and rejuvenating escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life, and a chance to connect with the raw power and majesty of nature.

It is one the most scenic and famous waterfall in Northeast India. Elephant falls is a popular tourist attraction in Shillong and it is a combination of three (3) rivers...

This is nice place for every one..
There are 3 different falls at this place. First one is easy.
Next two will require you to climb some steps up and down.
Though not slippery still watch out. All 3 waterfalls are of different kind.

Shillong is a place with so many picturesque falls, Elephanta falls is one of them. Its is a three layered falls and the volume of the water is very high as because most of the times Shillong is rainy.

Very well maintained stairs with proper standing and picture taking place.

Highly recommended to come and enjoy this place.

There are a few steps going down from the viewpoint to the base of the falls. Steps are not very steep and can be done by senior citizens. We did this trip in early April. It was a bit sunny on the road but the waterfall greeted us with a cool Breeze. There are some good photogenic points. Overall a good visit.

Located close to the EAC Upper Shillong, its a three tiered waterfalls. Named so by the British, because once there stood a large rock which resembled an elephant. But the rock no longer exists, since it supposedly toppled after the great Assam earthquake of 1897.
Howsoever, the falls is still very beautiful. One needs to climb down about a 100+ steps to reach the bottom of the falls, from where one may see the third and the most beautiful tier.
On full spate, it seems to be a falls of milk, as the water become white as it cascades down.
Swimming in the pool is prohibited.
There are gaurds stationed.
Entry fees is however hefty... Rs. 100/person. Kids below 10years are exempted.

The falls offer a beautiful and mesmerizing sight as the water cascades down from a height of over 20 meters. The natural beauty of the surrounding forests and rocks adds to the charm of the place. However, the site is not well-maintained, and the stairs leading to the falls are in poor condition, which may pose a challenge to some visitors. Despite this, the sheer beauty of the falls makes it worth the visit, especially for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.

The place is very well managed by MTDC. The entry fee is Rs 100 per head which is justified by the cleanliness and facilities provided here.

There are a total of three different waterfalls. I particularly liked the third one (lower most) as it has a beautiful pond in which you can see ducks waddling around.

Beautiful place to be with friends and family.

The waterfall is located in a beautiful forest, and the sight of the cascading water is truly mesmerizing. To get the full view of the waterfall, you need to trek down a steep path, which can be a bit challenging, but the effort is definitely worth it.

As I made my way down the path, I could hear the sound of the waterfall getting louder and louder, and the view became more and more stunning with each step. The sight of the powerful water flow was truly breathtaking. Once I reached the base of the waterfall, I felt like I was in a different world altogether. The cool mist from the waterfall felt refreshing on my skin, and I felt a sense of peace and tranquility that is hard to describe in words.

The trek down to the waterfall can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to hiking or trekking. However, the natural beauty of the surroundings and the magnificent view of the waterfall from the bottom make it all worth it. The entire experience is truly unforgettable, and I would highly recommend visiting Elephant Fall to anyone who loves nature and adventure.

In conclusion, Elephant Fall is a must-visit destination for anyone who loves waterfalls.

Chose the easier route and was pleasantly surprised to reach a large garden and a way to get quite close to the falls. It also has access to other areas near the fall which cannot be reached if coming by the more difficult route.

Visitors to Elephant Falls are treated to a breathtaking view of a multi-tiered waterfall cascading down the rocks, surrounded by lush greenery and towering trees. The falls are named after a rock formation that resembled an elephant, which unfortunately was destroyed in an earthquake. Nonetheless, the falls remain a popular tourist attraction in the region, and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the waterfall from several viewpoints and walking paths.

Apart from the natural beauty of the falls, visitors can also learn about the history of the area, as Elephant Falls played a significant role in the colonial history of India. The falls were named by the British during the colonial era, and they were a popular picnic spot for British officers and their families.

Visitors can also enjoy various activities around the falls, such as trekking, hiking, and birdwatching, making it a great destination for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers.

One thing to note is that the falls can get crowded, especially during peak tourist season, so its recommended to visit during off-peak times or arrive early in the day.

Overall, if youre looking for a scenic and historic destination in Shillong, a visit to Elephant Falls is a must. The natural beauty, rich history, and activities make it a great destination for all kinds of travelers.

Due to an earthquake in 1897, this rock was damaged.

The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a horsetail-punchbowl waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall, however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.
The sides of the waterfall are flanked by lush greenery and are rich in ferns.
A few ducks playing near the waterfall as well as some birds can be seen as well.
To reach the bottom of the falls, there are 125. The steps are well maintained but are a bit slippery in some parts. Due to presence of thick forest area, the temperature at the waterfalls is much cooler than the outside temperature.
Swimming is strictly prohibited in the waterfall.
At the entrance of waterfalls, visitors can also enjoy the traditional outfits and click some photographs with them.
Near the parking lot, there are couple of shops that sell local artifacts.",a year ago,2023-12-17T05:57:31,,,null,0,41,670,1,null,null

Why the name Elephant Falls?

ORIGINALLY THE KHASI PEOPLE NAMED THIS FALLS KA KSHAID LAI PATENG KHOHSIEW (THREE STEPS WATER FALLS) BECAUSE THE WATER FALLS INTO THREE STEPS.

WHEN THE BRITISHERS CAME AND FOUND THE WATER FALLS THEN THEY RENAMED IT ELEPHANT FALLS BECAUSE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FALLS THERE WAS A ROCK RESEMBLING AN ELEPHANT, BUT THIS ROCK WAS DESTROYED BY THE EARTHQUAKE IN THE YEAR 1897.

Beautiful and sound flowing water from falls. Waterfall is divided into 3 steps - first step is doable for all but 2nd and 3rd step falls is quiet deep and not easy for elder people to see 3rd step falls.
Crowded and need to watch steps carefully. You need good shoes or comfortable wear. Clean toilets near parking lot and well managed parking lot. It is worth to pay Rs 100 per person to see this water falls. Steps are nicely made with comfortable steps.

It is quite close yo shillong too. It is a 3 tiered waterfall. But when i visited in november, only the bottom most tier had considerable water. You need to climb down a set of stairs (~200 i think), so not recommended for the elderly. It is clean and well maintained. You will need ~30 minutes here.

But as per resources Britishers were coined the name Elephant Falls earlier they were ruled India. In that spot one big stone was stuck in the stream that seemed like an elephant. But after the 1950 Earthquake it was rolling away from the core of the stream but the name is still popular. Many people who visit take the photos for memory etc. It was a joyous moment for us to visit the place.

It has around 100-150(approximately) stairs with different height to get down to fall. Its a little tiring trek for old people so they can only enjoy 1st step of the falls and who can trek to the down can enjoy all 3 steps of the falls.

The security at the front of entrance at the elephant fall take 100 rs per person excluding the driver. After entering throw the gate we park our vehicle on the parking side allotted and we see that there are plenty of shops available for the tourists. There is provision available for tourists to capture their photos in traditional meghalya tribal dresses by hiring traditional dresses of the tribes of Meghalaya. The will check the entry pass bought at the entrance gate before entering the first fall. There are total three falls . We viewed the first waterfall and taken some photos from their. The second fall is situated below the first fall and there are stairs to go down to see the second fall. It is easy to go down and view the waterfall. So we went down and viewed the second waterfall but we cannot make to go down to the third waterfall as it is steep and it is easy to go down the stairs but it is hard to climb up the stairs again . So we ended our journey to the second fall. So we capture some photos at the second fall and viewed the awesome natural experience of the fall. It sounds much like the sound of river flowing in the forest. After that we bought some items from the shop available there and we returned.

Nature lovers come here to spend time amidst tranquility and enjoy the beauty of the surroundings. There are different vantage points from where you can witness the charm of Elephant Falls.

The interesting part of Elephant Falls is a two-tier waterfall cascading down the rocks. These curved falls catch the eye of the visitors and the surrounding green vegetation makes it an ideal picnic spot. Elephant Falls sections into three smaller waterfalls and the combined stream drops down the fern-covered rocks below.

There are 3 stages for viewing it and it is a normal one for a view.
The name of Elephant falls is due to the shape of the cave from where the falls run used to look like the mouth of an elephant and hence the name. But due to an earthquake the rock was damaged and hence you will not be able to see it anymore but during monsoon the falls look nice.
I will recommend not to visit this place as there are better falls in Shillong (Wakaba falls) on road to Cherrapunji which is far beautiful.
Here you will also get breakfast but the service is a bit slow.
If u have extra days in hand you can visit this place or else skip it.
We clicked some good pictures and thats all you will get at this place.

Parking: The entry is 50/- per head which includes the parking as well.

The weather is always good there when i been there it was not raining but it was feeling like its raining, it was like god has put some filter on the scene what im trying to say is that it was feeling like i was in movie. Nature is really something that we should respect and protect for our next generations. Elephant falls were one of the greatest place Ive ever been. Hope you guys have the same amazing time that i had. Love you all, peace and keep the gravity of the love hard. NATURE LOVE FOREVER

Toilet facilities are available free of cost and also drinking water. If you want to spend a good time here it will take 2-3 hours. It is situated near Shillong to Cherapunji road. If you are visiting Cherapunji you will get this place on the way. Outside food is available and you can have it inside the park but use a dustbin to keep the place clean.

The mountain stream cascades through the rocks surrounding Perani in two continuous cascades.
The Khasi language name of the waterfall is Ka Kshait Lai Pateng Kohsiw. It means three-level waterfall. Local people still use this name. However the current name is mentioned on a notice board near the falls. The big rock near the waterfall looks like an elephant. The British who saw it during the British rule named this waterfall as Elephant Falls. This rock was destroyed during an earthquake in 1987.",2 years ago,2022-12-17T05:58:47,,,null,0,459,333,1,"yaannnai aruvi (Elephant Falls) intiyaavinnn meekaalyaavinnn cillaangkil ullll irnnttu attukku niirviilllcciyaakum. mlai niiroottai, pernni cuulllntullll paarraikllinnn vllliyee irnnttu tottrcciyaannn niirviilllccikllaak viilllkirrtu.

You have to buy entry ticket which is not very expensive and climb down a bit to catch glimpse of this waterfall which has three layers

The first layer is pretty close about a 100 metre walk, second one would be at another 150 metres and to reach to the bottom and see the third layer you will have to walk another 100 metres or so. Even going to the second point gives you view of all three layers.

One can also get photo sessions done in traditional Khasi dresses at this waterfall by paying charges

The railed walkways begin at the head of the falls and continue to the bottom, ensuring that you not only see the magnificence of the falls from a close distance but also feel the spray of the cool water and the thunderous sound of the flow. The pool at the bottom of the falls is a tranquil spot where you can wade into the clear water at knee-level and get a nice picture with the giant cascade in the background.

The Khasi name for Elephant Falls is Kshaid-Lai-Pateng, which roughly refers to the three levels over which the water plunges. The name is rather misleading today - the elephant-shaped rock after which it was named by the British was destroyed in an earthquake more than a hundred years ago. At the entrance to Elephant Falls, there is a collection of stalls selling snacks and souvenirs.",2 years ago,2022-12-17T05:58:57,,,null,0,64,160,1,null,null

Its a must visit for tourists who are heading to Meghalaya. After purchasing the entry tickets, you need to take the hilly staircase downhill, while enjoying the waterfall running down by the side of the steps. The view is absolutely breathtaking. After reaching the lowest point, you will witness the full length of the waterfall and this location is apt for clicking photos. Highly recommended to visit.

Flanked by the beauty of the frothy water dropping in layers and dense green vegetation, it is a complete sight to behold and can be visited with family on a picnic or with friends for a days' outing. The awesome waterfall was named by the Britishers after a rock at its bottom that appears like an elephant. However, the uncanny resemblance was destroyed by an earthquake in 1897. With three layers of the falls accessible and surrounded in lush greenery, with crystal clear streams of water brushing through its rock, this mesmerizing sight is a complete tourists' paradise. Though the falls can be visited any time of the year, monsoons are the best time to see the falls in their full might and the magical feeling will remain engraved in your mind forever.

One of the British officers named it as Elephant falls after they saw a rock which resembled as an elephant. This rock was later destroyed due to earthquake in the year 1897.
In the local Khasi language, the name of the waterfall is Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohshiew whose literal translation from the Khasi language means 'the three-step waterfall'.
The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.",2 years ago,2022-12-17T05:59:16,,,null,0,41,351,1,null,null

The first of the three waterfalls are tucked between the dense trees and are very broad. The second waterfall reduces to thin strands of water and is almost negligible in winters due to the receding water levels. The third and the most visible waterfall is the tallest with clear water flowing like a sheet of milk on the dark rocks in the backdrop. Out of the three, the third waterfall tends to strike the visitors as the most impressive. Elephant Falls is a great stopover destination before one heads for further journeys into Meghalaya. Located 12 km away from the capital city of Shillong, it is one of the most visited falls in the beautiful state.

Very nice fall. Lucky that we did not have much rain when we visited so we could enjoy the scenic beauty without much trouble. The early morning rain had made the leaf greens even brighter. About 130-150 steps one way. Fall #2 is not that great. But the first and third are really good falls. Visited on 1st of May, had good volume of water flowing. During summer the water streams might be very thin. Near by shops have tea, coffee, snacks, corn etc. they also provide rented umbrella in case of rain. Would suggest to take it yourself as they charge 100/- rental for umbrella. Corn 40/- per piece. People also take photos here in traditional Khasi Costumes. The cab parking charge was 200/-. No person specific charges. Charges are per vehicle.

Must visit during rainy season. As you will be able to see three step waterfalls in its complete form. Dont visit during winter.

Elephant falls is quite close to Shillong. It has 3 falls. There are around 50 steps to get to the bottom. The hike down can be a little taxing but it is well worth it. Its not that difficult for aged persons also.

You have to pay 100 rs for each as entry fee for this site.Free parking is available.

There are some shops selling local handicrafts. Clean washrooms are available. Some small restaurants are also available.

There is a place where one can get tribal costumes on rent. They will even dress you up with all accessories.

The place is pretty clean and nicely maintained. Waterfall has good amount of flow and water looks pristine clean.

Why the name elephant falls is because the rock at the bottom most of the cascade looked like an elephant hence the British named it as Elephant falls and hence the name is from them. The people at the falls whether it is a contractor or the employees of government, they take extreme care in the upkeep of the falls meticulously clean. There are two caves type formation en-route which is a good place for taking selfies and pictures. Fortunately no bathing is allowed due to which the falls are clean.

Pros
1)Its natural waterfall anyways.
2)Cheap eatery. I had Maggie for RS 50.
3) Parking available.
4) Plenty of places to click photos.

Cons

1) RS 100 for entry fees, per person.

2) Not much water post rainy season.

However the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall.The name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock that looked like an elephant near the fall. This rock was destroyed in the 1897 due to an earthquake.
The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a horsetail-punchbowl waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among the trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.The sides of the waterfall are flanked by lush greenery and are rich in ferns.",3 years ago,2021-12-17T06:00:43,,,null,5,61,1024,1,null,null

This waterfall is formed by combining three beautiful and alluring rivers. The name Elephant falls was initially a British name. The local Khasi referred to it as Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew which also means the three step waterfalls. But the British renamed this to Elephant falls because they spotted a rock that looked like an elephant.

The rock however doesn't exist anymore because the rock got destroyed in an earthquake. It is not really a task to reach the Elephant waterfalls with so many public transport options available. One of the most stunning and beautiful natural wonders of the North East, if you love anything scenic you should be here.

History
The original Khasi name for the falls is Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew, which translates to the three - step waterfall. This name is still used locally. However the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall.The name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock that looked like an elephant near the fall.

There was a curious rock on one side of the falls which eerily resembled an elephant and hence the nomenclature. The eponymous rock was however destroyed in an earthquake in the year 1897 and the residual rock has been disintegrated since then due to the continuous barrage of water falling from a high altitude.
Like everything else it was renamed by the British, the Elephant Falls had a name before it received a colonial makeover. In the local Khasi language, the name of the waterfall is Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohshiew whose literal translation from the Khasi language means 'the three-step waterfall'. True to its name, the waterfall is divided into three steps literally. The first step of the waterfall is broad and sluggish and is lost amongst the dense forests all around, the second step though more concentrated lacks the huge drop and is often hidden from the public eye.

The third and the most important step comprises of a sheer vertical drop and a cascading flow of water which makes the falls one of the best waterfalls in the country. We can enjoy the beauty of two of the falls.

One can go to the Elephant Falls all year round but should really avoid the monsoon season due to the area becoming wet and prone to occasional landslides which would hamper the safety of tourists during that season. The summer season is a great time as one can beat the heat wave running throughout the country and enjoy a few days in the heart of nature.

You can go to the Elephant Falls all year round but should really avoid the monsoon season due to the area becoming wet and prone to occasional landslides which would hamper the safety during that season. The summer season is a great time as you can beat the heat wave running throughout the country and enjoy a few days in the heart of nature. It is situated about 12 km away from the Meghalayan capital city of Shillong. Hence cabs are available aplenty. This waterfall is one of the most frequently visited tourist spots of Shillong due to its close proximity to Shillong and its picturesque beauty. I really enjoyed the place a lot and hope you will also enjoy it.,3 years ago,2021-12-17T06:00:59,,,null,5,114,1331,1,null,null

Try to get to the falls during the morning hours. It is reasonably quiet and gives you a good feel, you will feel content by the very first view itself. Dont go by the ratings. It depends on which season youre visiting ,Best time to experience it is in rainy season. Do visit and get the thrilled experience.",3 years ago,2021-12-17T06:01:13,,,null,3,56,294,1,null,null
