Its just mesmerizing. Though people around arent that polite and helpful. First of all, the taxi drivers, they said there is no place near the monument to keep your luggage, so you have to keep your luggage with us and pay extra. When we reached there was free cloakroom near the monument.

Things didnt end here. Inside the monument a so called photographer said he is certified, clicked random photos and charged us 20 per photo and trust me not a single photo was worth it. We had clicked far better photos in our phones. He charged us around 700 for some unwanted photos.

I would like to say one thing, what do you people gain by cheating tourists around the world for a mere 100 rupees. You would earn a little extra but spoil the travelers whole mood and excitement.

Just felt disgusted.

Review:

The Taj Mahal is a breathtaking testament to the power of love and human ingenuity. Its intricate marble facade, adorned with delicate floral carvings and calligraphy, is a sight to behold. The symmetrical design and the play of light and shadow create a mesmerizing atmosphere.
While the crowds can be significant, especially during peak tourist seasons, the experience is still unforgettable. The early morning hours offer a more serene and less crowded visit, allowing you to truly appreciate the monuments beauty.
A guided tour can provide valuable insights into the history and architecture of the Taj Mahal. Dont miss the opportunity to explore the surrounding gardens, which are equally stunning and offer a peaceful respite from the bustling city.

Tips for visitors:
* Plan your visit: Consider visiting during the off-peak seasons (November to February or July to August) to avoid large crowds.
* Dress appropriately: Modest clothing is required, and avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless tops.
* Carry necessary items: Bring sunscreen, water, and comfortable shoes.
* Respect the monument: Adhere to the rules and regulations, and refrain from touching the marble surfaces.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is a must-see destination for anyone visiting India. Its timeless beauty and historical significance make it a truly unforgettable experience.

The whole experience was incredible! The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and its intricate details are mesmerizing. For the best and most scenic views, visit either early in the morning or in the evening when the light creates a stunning atmosphere.

I'll spare you the history, everyone knows Moghul Emperor Shahjahan built this tomb after his wife Mumtaz Mahal died . Just imagine this was built during 1631-1658 manually located in Agra .

When I saw the dome of the Taj Mahal from outside before entering the main gate, it was a once-in-a-lifetime moment that was truly unforgettable. Words cannot express the beauty of that sight.

It is surreal when you enter from the main gate and see the Taj Mahal receding from your sight, The view was truly magnificent. Once inside, I sat on the floor and gazed at the Taj Mahal for over an hour without moving.

However, the place was overcrowded with many .People were striking funny poses for photographers. One funny example is trying to imitate the famous pose of raising one hand and touching the tip of the Taj Mahal .

Despite this, the Taj Mahal offers a variety of experiences - from a sense of peace when ignoring the chaos around you, to moments of joy when observing the surroundings, and even situations that could potentially make you angry. It is a place where you can never feel bored.

Although I am not sharing my experience with scammers around the Taj Mahal because everyone might be aware of that issue.

A quick note on the tickets: there are two options - 50 and 250. The 250 ticket includes access to the mausoleum, but personally, I didn't find it worth the extra cost. Overall, a must-visit, but plan your timing and ticket choice accordingly!

It is a masterpiece which is difficult to re-create with the same intricacies and finesse.
Not only the Taj Mahal, but the entire area is well maintained with greenery all around and cleanliness is also fully maintained.
When we visited, all the water bodies were without water as there was some cleaning project happening, but still it did not impact the beauty of the giant marble structure.
It is recommended to visit in the first half of the day or early mornings are much better to avoid unwanted crowds and to appreciate the real magnificence.
If one wants to go inside the massive building, there are separate tickets of 200 and 250 and need to buy disposable shoe covers from the counter or lot of hawkers selling it outside for 10 for each pair. Though reusable ones are available too, but they are filthy and smelling. Entry tickets are for 40 each and children can visit for free.
If you get a chance to visit, do not miss the opportunity and show it to the younger generation too.

Telling me that the waiting time to go in might take 45 - 60 mins.
If I use him, no waiting time and everything will be express. He quoted me 1800 rupee and it was raining at that time. Wanted to use him but in the end , he bought me to a parking place that need to pay 100 rupee and after that I decided not to because before he told me that parking is free.

After that , I managed to park at the area where the electric bungee were and paid 20 rupee for the bungee to get in to the ticket counter. Upon arriving at the parking , there are a lot more guides knocking at my door.
Some charges 200 rupee to get tickets for me.
Some asking for 500 rupee as a guide. But I had rejected all and took the bungee in.
There was no Q at all at the counter and the process was fast.
A lot of people there trying to be nice to help me guide the way , sell umbrella , rent , or even pass me the umbrella but after that wanted me to go to their shops.
But I had rejected all and decided to just walk in the rain.
Process for checking the bags and body checks was chaotic. No food allowed , I had sweets in my bag and was asked to throw. I had a talisman that I bought at leh which was forbidden to bring in and I threw it away during the check too.
After that , it's the walk and the majestic view.
Its was raining and windy.
And I think that there would be more people if there was no rain.
When everything is finish , going back out , I got to face the shops owners asking me to go in their shops and the waiting for the bungee ride are in a mess.
But somehow I managed to get up 1 and this time I didn't pay anything. I don't know why.
But I am grateful that I am able to witness everything and was safe.
Hope I can help people who want to come here to understand more of how the process is like.
And the ticket is 1300 rupee including the walk in the museum. I advise to get them too rather then just paying 1100 rupee to go in.

Early for the sunrise. No queues as such.
Electric vehicles from the drop off point to the entry point. Buy tickets and then through security screening. Double check the list of things you cannot bring in.
As a group, we got a photographer who took all of our group photos. Cost is IDR$100 per photo or in bulk deal and you get paper photo and electronic copy as well.
Both the long distance wide angle photo and from the Diana seat. Well worth it.
We chose to go barefoot on the marble instead of wearing the shoe covers. It felt so good to be walking on such hallowed grounds in bare feet.
Awesome and truly amazing place.
Highly recommend to everyone.
Note : There are hawkers inside the grounds who will help with photos or provide artistic guidance for a tip.

A Must-Visit Experience

The Taj Mahal is an absolute must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply experiencing the beauty of human creation. Be prepared to be mesmerized by its grandeur and left with memories to cherish forever.

Its a wonder for a reason. Its good to avail a tour guide to understand how awesome this monument is. A few tips would be to buy shoe covers only if you were to visit the museum inside Taj and if bought online tickets would be discounted by 5 Rs. Preferably visit in the early morning to avoid crowds.

The beauty of the white marble structure is beyond words, especially at sunrise when the monument glows softly. The intricate details of the carvings and the symmetry of the gardens make it a photographer's paradise. As you walk closer, the craftsmanship becomes even more mesmerizing. The history and love story behind it add an emotional depth to the visit. Be prepared for crowds, but the experience is absolutely worth it.

Tajmahal has its own beauty which is really pleasant to see. We went there on weekends early in the morning and was surprised to see the crowd at that time. It was very crowded. So I guess there is no day when we see less crowd. People from all over the place came to adore its beauty. Weather was pleasant as it was monsoon when we went there. For tickets we purchased online but make sure to buy from ASI website as it will be easier to get in. For night view of tajmahal.. tickets are only available when there is full moon chances. Otherwise it is not available. Must visit place with family and friends. Make sure not to take any food items or plastic water bottles. Can carry Personal water bottles. Keep hats,cap handy in summers. For luggage cloak room facilities are available. To reach to taj mahal any of the gate, one can walk or can take golf cart with 20rs pp charge.

Advisable to get tickets online or from the QR scanner for payment available approximately 100m before the turnstile entry gate.

2. Best time is to visit early in the morning. Reach here at 6am and you will find less crowd and low temperature. There are few small shops inside providing water bottles and snacks.

3. For Indian tourists, seeing Taj Mahal from outside costs 50 INR and to get inside it costs 200 INR extra. So in total its 250/-. However there is a small discount for online tickets. You can get the above tickets in two parts of 50 and 200 from the counter or also directly 250. So if one takes only INR 50 ticket to just watch the Taj Mahal but later wishes to also get inside it, he can take 200/- ticket from the counter just outside the main Taj Mahal monument.

4. Inside the Taj Mahal you can go barefoot or with shoe cover. The reusable cloth shoe cover is available free of cost at the counter which is just outside the main Taj Mahal monument entrance. The shoe cover then needs to be deposited in the big containers at the exit.

5. Overall it will take 2-4 hours to complete the tour. The entry starts at approximately 5:30am in the morning till approximately 5 or 5:30 pm in the evening. However the selling of tickets both online and offline may stop early at around 5pm approximately. So at least by 4:30 pm one should reach the place.

6. The outermost entry gate is just at one minute walking distance from the Taj Mahal Metro Station. From this outermost entry gate, it will take 10-45min to reach the actual Taj Mahal by walking. All depending on the crowd and timing of the visit. It took us around 30 min overall including the time spent in the entry line, and also it was our first visit so that also adds to the time. Also we went on Saturday.

7. There are some 11-seater (approx) golf carts that are available just inside the outermost entrance gate for those who dont want to walk. They help you save only five to ten minutes of walking time. So we didnt opt for it.

8. Best time to reach is before 7am or after 4pm.

9. Its closed on Friday.

10. Taking photos is allowed almost everywhere with few exceptions.

11. Food items are not allowed to be carried inside. Water bottles are allowed. Checking of bags is properly done at the turnstile entry gate. However it may be possible to sneak in a toffee or two.

As you approach this iconic monument, the anticipation builds, and the moment you catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels as though youve stepped into a dream. The Taj Mahals ethereal beauty defies words; its sheer size, the intricate details of the carvings, and the symmetry of the entire structure make it a sight to behold.

Upon arrival, you are greeted by helpful local guides, who share fascinating insights into the history and craftsmanship behind the Taj. Their stories bring the monument to life, weaving a narrative of love, loss, and architectural brilliance. They also know the best spots for photographs, helping you capture the magic of the moment.

One of the most thoughtful aspects of the visit is the battery-operated cabs that ferry visitors to and from the parking area. These eco-friendly vehicles ensure that the serene ambiance around the Taj Mahal remains undisturbed by pollution or noise. The short ride through the well-maintained approach road allows you to gather your thoughts and prepare yourself for the awe-inspiring sight that awaits.

As you walk through the grand entrance and the Taj Mahal comes into full view, you cant help but feel a sense of wonder and reverence. The shimmering reflection in the long pool, the peacefulness of the surroundings, and the sheer majesty of the monument create an experience that feels almost otherworldly.

The visit to the Taj Mahal is a journey not just through space, but through time and emotion--a truly surreal experience that stays with you long after youve left.

However, the ticket price for entering the mausoleum is QR 200, which I found a bit high. One thing to note is that you'll need shoe covers or you'll have to carry your shoes in hand, as they don't sell covers inside, so it's best to bring them from outside. There's also a Taj Museum worth visiting, but be aware that its hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, which differs from the Taj Mahal's visiting hours.

Park your vehicle in the government authorised parking and take a golf buggy which charges Rs. 20 from parking to the main entrance gate. Get the tickets either from agents by paying Rs 20-25 per ticket extra or you can get the tickets on your own by booking online through the Taj Mahal online booking portal and that is a very easy process. You have two options to buy tickets either for Rs. 50 or Rs. 245. For Rs 50 you will get entry to the Taj Mahal area but I will recommend you to buy the ticket for Rs 245 which will give you access to enter the Taj Mahal and there you can see the burial of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan and the actual view of Taj Mahal premises.

The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million) VB The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year.

We arrived just before sunrise, spent 3 hours there (max. time allowed per ticket) and of course it was a highlight of our trip.

No queues at 5 am (on a weekday) to buy the tickets or entry. Staff were wide awake and helpful. A free bottle of water and shoe covers are given free.

You will be approached by guides and professional photographers, a polite refusal is fine.

Carry as little as possible in your bag to get through security smoothly.

Watch out for the monkeys in the outer compound.

Once inside the main area, amateur photographers will try to guide you to the best photo spots and take pictures for you with your phone.

We had a little old man do it for us (free at first, he never asked for money) at first we reluctantly accepted his help, and were SO glad we did. He knew all the best spots and angles. He took awesome pics and short videos so at the end we tipped him gladly.

Inside the mausoleum was worth the extra admission. The attendants inside will suck you in with rapid fire information, then ask for a tip.

There is a museum to the left of the main area but it only opens at 9am.

It was an effort to get up so early but well worth it to avoid the crowds and see the magnificent Taj Mahal in the early morning light.

Pity about the fountains and ponds being empty. Some renovation and getting them working would have made the main area even more magical and created a nice cooling effect.

But this was a small thing. We were so glad we came.

Pro:
April/May is summer, so there weren't too many people!  We could soak in the beauty without the usual massive crowds

Con:
It's HOT. Like, seriously HOT!  Be ready for the sun and heat, especially if you're there later in the day. Bring a hat or sunscreen 

We got our tickets on the spot --1,100 rupees for Southeast Asian tourists like us  It includes a super helpful tour guide & bottled water 

We got there bright and early at 5 AM to catch the sunrise & it was magical! 

Since it was so early, the place was practically less crowded. As the day went on, it did get busier, so the early bird definitely gets the best views 

Our tour guide gave us all the details about the Taj Mahal's history --from how it was built to all the little stories that made it so special

Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is a whole other level. It's so much bigger and more beautiful than we ever imagined . The surrounding gardens are gorgeous too --perfect for taking a little break in the shade

Afterward, our guide took us to a souvenir shop . It was a bit pricey , and they claimed the items were made with stones used in the Taj Mahal itself. We couldn't resist and bought something, but by the time we got back to home, it had cracked 

Overall, it was such an unforgettable experience

You can buy tickets inside, not so crowded, I would not ask you to buy tickets beforehand but definitely would recommend an early morning visit. The sunrise behind the Taj is just mesmerizing!

Unfortunately, the way to go there (the pathway from East Gate smells of pee. Plus once you arrive, a lot of tour guides will follow you and keep insisting you to take them as your guide, even if you already said no so many times. It really ruined the mood. And the vibes of the place.

It should be a magical place because a part of the world wonders, but too many local people who always push to offer something (guides, photographer, postcard etc) will really annoy tourists who are already tired from walking and the honks from the road, and want to just enjoy the place.

Hopefully, in the future, there will be a more organized system for the guides and photographers.

The water quality of the nearby Yamuna River is severely polluted, leading to a massive infestation of insects, which in turn contaminate the buildings.

The low water level of the Yamuna River has caused the foundations of the Taj Mahal to dry out and become brittle.

The beauty of the Taj Mahal is truly unmatched, and I had a great time exploring its majestic architecture.

One of the highlights of my visit was the availability of a cameraman who can take stunning photos for you, making it easy to capture those perfect memories. I even shared some of my photos, and they turned out great! However, I found the ticket price to enter the mausoleum a bit expensive, so I wouldnt recommend going inside unless youre very keen on seeing the interiors.

For those worried about staying hydrated, theres good news! You can get Pune water inside the premises as long as you have a water bottle with you.

Overall, it was a memorable trip, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Just be mindful of the additional costs if youre planning to explore every aspect of the site.

The symetery of the architecture and certain optical illusions are amazing. Taj appears different at dawn, dusk, in bright sunlight and on full moon nights, Definitely worth adding to the bucket list make sure you carry just your phone and wallet. Bags are not allowed, and you will need disposable shoe covers by the ticket, which includes the mausoleum . Just outside, there are a few souvenir shops . My advice would be by a thing if you feel it is worth it, and then don't compare prices.

The entry process has two main fees: 50 to enter the first gate and an additional 200 to go inside the Taj Mahal itself. Its essential to be cautious when dealing with guides. Many can be pushy, and some might try to overcharge or pressure you into additional services. If you plan on hiring a guide, make sure to confirm the price upfront and clarify what it includes. After your tour of the Taj Mahal, be sure to pay and settle the deal immediately.

Some guides might try to control your shopping experience by taking you to specific shops where they receive commissions, often leading you to a place falsely advertised as a mini Taj Mahal. These shops typically sell overpriced items. To avoid this, be firm in your choices and opt for exploring local markets on your own if possible.

The Taj Mahal is undoubtedly worth the visit, but a little caution can go a long way in ensuring a memorable experience.

As the first rays of the sun gently kiss the pristine white marble, the entire monument seems to radiate with a soft, golden light. This moment, fleeting and delicate, gives the Taj an ethereal beauty, as if its floating in a dreamlike world. The cool morning air adds to the serenity, allowing visitors to absorb the grandeur of this architectural masterpiece in peace and reflection.

The symmetry of the Taj Mahal, with its majestic domes and minarets, stands in stark contrast to the quiet of the early hours. There's a stillness, broken only by the songs of birds and the soft murmur of the Yamuna River in the distance. The marble's intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones sparkle subtly, enhanced by the soft sunlight, and every detail comes alive under this natural glow.

Seeing the Taj Mahal at dawn is more than just a visual experience; it's deeply emotional. The monument, built as a testament to Shah Jahan's undying love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, evokes feelings of timelessness, loss, and beauty. As the sun continues to rise, the colors of the sky shift from pale blues to warm oranges, wrapping the Taj in a soft embrace that seems almost heavenly.

To truly understand the allure of the Taj Mahal, one must experience this sacred moment. It's not just a wonder of architecture but a place where nature and artistry come together, leaving you with a sense of awe and peace that lingers long after the sun has fully risen.

As one of the Seven Wonders of the World, it truly lives up to its reputation. The beauty and serenity of the Taj Mahal are unparalleled--its a sight to behold and a peaceful retreat.

The security is tight, which is reassuring given the number of visitors. The complex is well-maintained, though it can get crowded, especially with photographers trying to capture the perfect shot. It costs 30 for a single photo, and you might end up spending quite a bit if you want multiple shots.

Entry to the Taj Mahal costs 50, and if you want to visit the tomb inside, theres an additional charge of 250. Despite these costs, the experience is well worth it. The majesty of the monument and the historical significance make it a must-visit for anyone traveling to India. Highly recommended for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply appreciating an iconic piece of heritage!

The ""Taj Mahal"" truly lives up to its iconic status.
Visiting this masterpiece was a dream come true. The intricate marble work, the stunning symmetry, and the serene gardens left me speechless.
Its not just a monument; its a testament to love and craftsmanship. The experience was enhanced by knowledgeable guides who shared captivating stories about its history.
A must-visit for anyone exploring Indias rich heritage.

Must visit atleast once in a life time.

Dont take guide.. if u want take then for 300 to 400.. also Avoid professional photographers unless u wanted a printed photo.. i paid about a lot(only for soft copies) and then came to know that they cheated me.. they didnt accept for less than 10 photos. And they charge 40 rs for each photo.. seems 20 rs is reasonable for soft copy as they are taking more photos.. my phone camera quality was actually good... I should have considered photographers when i exit the taj mahal.. they were very rude also...

There s a museum inside the campus.. you can find very interesting things used by moghuls.. i liked the plate that turns color or breaking into pieces when it is exposed with poisonous food.

Car parking 100 rs.. take 20 rs battery operated car for 1km ride to reach the main gate.. get tickets online if possible..

There is a clock room to keep things.. food items are not.allowed.. selfie sticks are also not allowed..

Purchase shoe cover for 10 rs for mausoleum visiting.. photography is prohibited inside mausoleum..

The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million).

The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperors court architect.

Visiting the Taj Mahal was an unforgettable experience. This iconic monument lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places in the world. Here are my thoughts:

1. Architectural Beauty:
The Taj Mahal's architecture is simply breathtaking. The white marble seems to glow, especially at sunrise and sunset. The intricate carvings and the perfect symmetry make it feel like a work of art. The dome and the four surrounding minarets are an impressive sight up close.

2. Emotional Connection:
Knowing the history behind the Taj Mahal, built as a symbol of love by Emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, added a deeply emotional layer to my visit. It feels more than just a building--it's a tribute to eternal love and devotion, which made the experience even more meaningful.

3. Serene Surroundings:
The gardens and the reflection pool surrounding the monument create a peaceful atmosphere. Despite the crowds, I found moments of quiet where I could simply appreciate the beauty and calmness of the environment.

4. Crowds and Experience:
The Taj Mahal can get quite crowded, especially during peak times. However, even with the number of people, the beauty of the place shines through. I would recommend visiting early in the morning to avoid large crowds and enjoy a more peaceful experience.

5. Overall Impressions:
Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or simply want to witness one of the wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It's a timeless monument that captivates you from the moment you step inside the gates. I left feeling inspired and moved by both its beauty and the story behind it.",a week ago,2024-10-16T08:06:14,,,null,0,12,2,1,null,null

However, the crowd situation has improved recently, and it's not as crowded as it used to be. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting between 9 am and 12 pm when it's less crowded.
I recommend buying tickets online in advance. This will save you time and ensure a smoother entry.
There are two value tickets for Indians: one for appreciating the view from the garden area (Rs 50) and another for exploring the tombs from upstairs and inside (Rs 250).
Additionally, there's a higher value ticket (Rs 1300) that allows you to avoid the crowd at the main entry.

Built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this UNESCO World Heritage site is often regarded as the epitome of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles seamlessly.

The first sight of the Taj Mahal is breathtaking. Its pristine white marble facade glistens under the sun, reflecting in the pool that runs along the front gardens, creating a picture-perfect view.
The symmetry, intricate carvings, and inlay work of semi-precious stones make it a masterpiece of art and craftsmanship. The central dome, flanked by four smaller domes and four slender minarets, creates an awe-inspiring silhouette against the sky.
Inside the mausoleum, the artistry continues with delicate marble lattice screens and intricate pietra dura (stone inlay) work. The serene interior houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, surrounded by a peaceful ambiance that invites quiet reflection.
The surrounding gardens, known as the Charbagh, are beautifully landscaped and provide a serene setting to enjoy the beauty of the monument from different angles.

The Yamuna River flowing behind the Taj Mahal adds to its tranquility, especially at sunrise and sunset when the monument takes on different hues, from soft pink to golden and pearly white.The experience of visiting the Taj Mahal is further enriched by knowledgeable guides who provide insights into its history, architecture, and the poignant love story behind its creation. Despite the crowds, the monuments beauty and historical significance make it worth the visit.
Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument but an experience that leaves visitors spellbound by its beauty, historical significance, and the timeless love story it represents. A visit to India would be incomplete without witnessing this wonder of the world.

Ticket booking counter also opens before sunrise. I would suggest to take an official guide as it is very helpful and it ensures that we are not getting cheated by any local fraud and it make sense as they bring good information about the places which we cannot get by our own.

Oh and tickets can be bought online, and there too with a scanner instead of standing in line.

Do not waste your money on the shops inside, they sell the same things on the street unless you want to invest in a piece of furniture or something big. Outside you can bargain. Overall a memorable experience. What an amazing mesmerising piece of history.

Some people call it a must-see while others describe it as stunning and mesmerizing. Here are some insights from reviews:

Beauty

Most people see the Taj Mahal as architecture and beauty at its best because it changes color during different times of the day.

Time of day

Others say that sun rises up at six am when gates open. It is also said to be a busy place during sunset especially near marble seating.

Photography

It has also been mentioned that photographing inside isn't allowed but outside can be done from a distance. Security personnel will blow whistles on anybody who tries taking photos within the mausoleum's precincts since cameras may also be seized.

Other attractions

They also encourage tourists to visit other places such as Sikandra, Fatehpur Sikri and other tombs of Akbar, Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb etc in Agra beside famous AgraFort.

1. Try to take the early morning ticket. The morning entry begins 30 minutes before sunrise and it is wonderful to watch the Taj at sunrise

2. Book tickets online. It will save you a lot of time. The tickets cost Rs 45/- for Indians and Rs 1,050/- for a foreigner.

3. If you want to enter the mausoleum its Rs 200/- more per person. Its worth it .

4. The line for foreigners is really really long so try and queue up early.

5. Kids below 15 years both Indian and Foreign, get in free

Your best bet is to go at sunrise when there are few tourists and you will have ample time to walk all over the grounds and take photos. I went there around 8:30 AM in early October, and it was already crowded.
Enter from the east gate. Thats where most of the hotels, restaurants, shops and guides are.
Do get a registered tour guide, but only outside the ticket counter, not from anywhere else. You can negotiate with them.
If you want to get professional photos inside, each hard copy would cost you INR 100, while each soft copy would cost you INR 80. However, the number of pictures you get taken could easily reach 100, so keep that in mind.
Get the ticket for the mausoleum as well, the design inside is stunning.

Everyone knows Taj Mahal. But I saw it for the first time. It is very beautiful. The one who has kept it like this even after so many years should be praised the most.
Such a view as soon as you enter. Truly a wonder.
You may face some difficulty in reaching Taj Mahal. Like traffic, route divert and parking. Car parking goes up to 20/hr.
To book tickets, I would say that you should book online only so that you will avoid standing in the queue. I would like to tell you one more thing in this, the normal ticket is 40-30, in which you can only go around the Taj Mahal but not inside the Taj Mahal. For this you will have to pay 200 extra and children up to 15 years of age are free to take them anywhere in Taj Mahal. Means no ticket. If you want to go to Taj Mahal, you will get shoe covers for which you do not have to pay anything extra. If you do not want to go to the Taj Mahal and just want to roam around the Taj Mahal, then you do not have to cover your shoes.

It is said that Shahjahan built it as a symbol of his eternal love for his beloved wife.

The delicate carvings and inlays on the marble are a masterpiece of Islamic art, and are truly magnificent.

Walking through the corridors and feeling the aura of devotion and respect is a PROFOUND experience.

The view of the YAMUNA RIVER in the background adds a touch of SERENITY to the already perfect setting.

You can buy your tickets alone at the entrance, no matter what the people who approach you on the street tell you.

At the entrance, people say they work there and tried to offer free tours, free photos... all scams, of course, so always be careful and refuse anything you dont want to pay for.

There are water fountains inside TAJ, but there are no vendors and you cannot bring food.

Dont take a tripod, drone, cigarette, pen... the list of what you cant enter is huge.

At 2pm, TAJ wasnt that crowded, we were able to take beautiful photos, but when we were leaving at 5pm, the number of people had tripled. It was 35 degrees on the day and there are few shadows.

Inside TAJ you can take photos wherever you want, but some photographers try to convince you otherwise, dominating the best photo spots, as if you could only take photos there if you paid them. Dont accept this, organize your space and only leave after photographing as you wish.

, I told my friends that we should first ride on the R-cart of the tourist department, but we were trapped in the sweet language of the e-rickshaw drivers. That e-rickshaw driver took us from the West Gate back to the Main Road and then through the narrow streets and dropped us at the East Gate. During this entire journey, mine and my friends knees collided with other e-rickshaws many times. Had they collided, we would have had to spend a few days in the hospital and it is not known how long we would be able to walk properly.
My request to everyone is that the best way to go to Taj Mahal is from the West Gate and to go inside from the parking here, use the e-cart of the tourist department which has about 12 seats. And whenever you travel anywhere by e-rickshaw etc., do not take your feet out of the e-rickshaw at all. Otherwise any serious accident can happen to you. And if you go by purchasing the ticket online, it will be even better, you will not have to stand in line for the ticket.

essay on Taj Mahal

Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people associate India with the Taj Mahal. However, for me, more than the spectacular architecture, it is the story behind it that fascinates me the most. This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of a husbands love for his wife. Furthermore, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for future generations.

Taj Maha - Symbol of Love
The famous Taj Mahal was brought to life from the vision of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He built this memorial for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her death.

To honor the memory of his beloved wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from around the world to create it. He wanted to create something that had never been created for anyone before. The king wanted to give his last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.

It was built in the 17th century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.[1]

Duration: 10 minutes and 7 seconds.10:07
Taj Mahal incomparable heritage
Mughal architecture was at its peak during the time of Mughal emperor Shahjahan, Taj Mahal is the most famous example of that architecture. Taj Mahal is an excellent example of Mughal architecture. Its architectural style is a unique fusion of elements from Persian, Ottoman, Indian and Islamic architecture. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with this, it was described as one of the most universally praised human creations of world heritage. Taj Mahal has also been declared the gem of Islamic art of India. Unlike the commonly seen buildings which are covered with large sheets of marble blocks, its white dome and tiles are covered [2] with marble in shape. The tomb built in the center shows the combination of beauty in its architectural superiority. The special thing about the structure of the Taj Mahal building group is that it is completely symmetrical. Its construction was completed around 1648. [1] Ustad Ahmed Lahauri is often considered its chief designer. [3] It took about 22 years to construct the Taj Mahal.

architecture
Main article: Origins and architecture of Taj Mahal
mausoleum

Map of floor plan of Taj Mahal
The centerpiece of the Taj Mahal is the white marble mausoleum built on a square foundation. It is a symmetrical building, which has an iwan i.e. a very large curved (arch-shaped) door. A large dome adorns the top of this building. Like most Mughal tombs, its basic components are of Persian origin.

basic premise
Its basic foundation is a huge multi-chambered structure. This main chamber is cubic, each side of which is 55 meters (see: floor map, right). On the long sides is a massive pishtaq, or arched-roofed chamber gate. It is connected to the arched balcony above.

main arch
On either side of the main arch, two additional pishtaqs are built on either side, one above the other. In the same style, two pishtaqs (one above the other) are built on all four sides of the chamber. This structure is completely symmetrical on each side of the building, which makes the building an octagon rather than a square, but since the four corner sides are much shorter than the other four sides, it would be appropriate to call it square. The four towers around the tomb seem to frame the view of the building, at the four corners of the original base post. The main chamber contains the fake tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shahjahan. These are very decorated, and their original is situated on the lower floor.

Ive always wanted to go to the Taj Mahal. He finally went. I went early in the morning, so it was beautifully illuminated by the morning sun. The mausoleum is huge and beautiful, and it also has a melancholy feel to it. The whiteness of marble rather than chalk, and the beauty of the symmetry were also wonderful. There is a strict inventory check to enter. You can get water inside. There is a replica grave inside the mausoleum, so photos are not allowed. But since it is a mausoleum, there is only a grave. The Taj Mahal has an amazing exterior that somehow reminded me of Mont Saint Michel in France. The silhouette is also beautiful. My advice is to go during the dry season. In the summer it would be too hot, and in the rainy season it would be cloudy and difficult to see. It seems best to go when its not raining or hot. If its not sunny, the beauty may be halved.

For practical reasons: you cannot bring cigarettes, lighters, or food with you (everything edible will be taken away at the entrance). Although small nuts would be useful to feed the chipmunks, of which there are many.
You cant even take photos inside the mausoleum, even with your phone, but the carved fence is worth a look. I advise you to ask the attendant to highlight the marble and stone inlay (he does this with a flashlight) - an unforgettable impression of translucent natural stones.

Before entering the Taj Mahal you must cross a large alley in the middle of a park, the place is well landscaped wooded. There are macaques so be careful not to approach them because they can be very aggressive! The place is crowded but its worth the detour. You will climb the steps that lead to the palace in slippers because it is considered sacred and it is marble so no shoes on it to preserve its whiteness and purity.

This mausoleum is a mix of perfection and symmetry, it is no coincidence that it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world.
I was lucky enough to visit it twice in the space of three days.

I highly recommend going there at these hours, the colors and lights make everything even more spectacular. Even inside you will be enchanted by the beauty and perfection.
We didnt find much queue at the ticket counter, also because foreigners have a dedicated queue. Entry costs 1300 INR, perhaps the most expensive attraction entry in northern India, but worth it. Absolutely.
You can enter from the east and west entrances, while only exit is permitted in the south. They are all well signposted.

Consiglio vivamente di andarci a queste ore, colori e luci rendono il tutto ancora piu spettacolare. Anche allinterno verrete ammaliati dalla bellezza e dalla perfezione.

Non abbiamo trovato molta coda al ticket counter, anche perche gli stranieri hanno una fila dedicata. Lingresso costa 1300 INR, forse lingresso per unattrazione piu caro nellindia nel nord, ma ne vale la pena. Assolutamente.

For Japanese people, when they think of India, they think of curry, Dhalsim from Street Fighter, and one of the most famous things: the Taj Mahal.
Since I went on a tour, I left the purchasing of admission tickets and procedures to the guide.
A guide will accompany you to the viewpoint where you can see the Taj Mahal, but you will have to enter the Taj Mahal alone.
Once inside, a guide-like Indian man will give you a brief explanation in English and then ask for a tip, but there is no need to pay.
The guide had warned me about this beforehand, and I was able to understand it by actually facing it.
You can request a photographer outside to take pictures through the guide, but the guide will take the pictures with his own camera (smartphone), so unless you want to use a good camera, there is no need to ask for one. I thought.

It is truly amazing to see it up close and you can take some spectacular photos. Lets not forget that it is a tomb so remember that you must have respect and you cannot take photos inside.
Things to keep in mind:
- It is inside a park and to access it you have to walk for a while. There are little trains available but you have to pay. The walk is pleasant and safe but it is about 10 minutes on foot.
- You have to visit it early in the morning around 6/7 ideally. The reason is the extreme heat, especially because the white marble reflects the sun and in summer it can reach 47-50 degrees near the building.
- You are not allowed to bring anything, cigarettes, food, etc. will be confiscated. The best thing is to take your water bottle and cell phone for photos and thats it.
- Be careful with street vendors when you go out!! They are everywhere and there are many people attentive to your wallet.
- It is necessary to pay entry. You can buy it online beforehand to avoid lines.

Es una autentica pasada verla de cerca y se pueden hacer unas fotos espectaculares. No olvidemos que es una tumba asi que recordar que hay que tener respeto y no se pueden hacer fotos dentro.

Cosas a tener en cuenta:

- Esta dentro de un parque y para acceder hay que andar un rato. Hay trenecitos disponibles pero hay que pagar. El paseo es agradable y seguro pero son unos 10 minutos a pie.

- Hay que visitarlo por la manana pronto sobre las 6/7 idealmente. El motivo es el calor extremo, sobre todo porque el marmol blanco refleja el sol y en verano se puede llegar a los 47-50 grados cerca del edificio.

- No se permite llevar nada, los cigarros, comida, etc te los requisaran. Lo mejor es llevarte tu botella de agua y movil para fotos y ya.

- Cuidado con los vendedores ambulantes cuando sales!! Estan por todos y hay mucha gente atenta a tu cartera.

- Es necesario pagar entrada. Puedes comprarla online previamente para evitar colas.

It is also included in the list of seven wonders of the world. Most of the foreign tourists come to India to see it. This is considered a sign of love. Its carvings and decoration of precious colored stones are worth seeing. The fountain and flower garden in front of the main building further enhances its beauty.

The discount they give is better than the change. With these tickets they give you a discount of 50 rupees if you want to see the Red Fort later. Another option is to take them out in the morning and go just at dawn at 5:30, 5:45 or 6 and enter through the west door. Immediately go to the mosque area. From there, with the sun rising, the photos are spectacular. Next, go to the guest area (opposite side of the mosque) and with a mobile phone on the ground or spilling water on the ground you will get some impressive mirror photos. Then you can return to the central pond to take photos from the canal and finally from the cloisters. from the Darwan gate and at the entrance. The length of stay is 3 hours and be careful that they will constantly overwhelm you for guides, photos, etc. If it is not your plan, say no to everything.
