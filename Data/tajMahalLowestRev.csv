Some people call it a must-see while others describe it as stunning and mesmerizing. Here are some insights from reviews:

Beauty

Most people see the Taj Mahal as architecture and beauty at its best because it changes color during different times of the day.

Time of day

Others say that sun rises up at six am when gates open. It is also said to be a busy place during sunset especially near marble seating.

Photography

It has also been mentioned that photographing inside isn't allowed but outside can be done from a distance. Security personnel will blow whistles on anybody who tries taking photos within the mausoleum's precincts since cameras may also be seized.

Other attractions

They also encourage tourists to visit other places such as Sikandra, Fatehpur Sikri and other tombs of Akbar, Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb etc in Agra beside famous AgraFort.

But, I would like to list the things which would make me think to never visit this place again in my lifetime
1. Ticket cost - 50(to see only the garden), 250(to go inside the mausoleum) - even this seems acceptable as they want to control the crowd visiting the mahal inside and preserve its heritage
2. Electric Golf cart - for taking one from the parking to entrance charged at 20/person(for less than 500m) - most imp is the tickets are not provided for everyone (given only those who asks for it) and the fare is taken by this drivers without any accountability to government.
3. Shoe cover - for going inside the mausoleum, the shoes need to be covered with the cover. But the reusable cloth cover(provided free of cost) has all the dirt than the shoes. Also the clean use and throw cover is charged 10 each separately (as a separte business inside) - wonder why all these are charged outside the ticket cost when we cant go imside without it
Its not about the amount they charge, but its about the unethical practice they are following.

- Smartphones/phones are not allowed at Taj Mahal (these are orders by magistrate)
- How much ever you try plan viewing the Taj Mahal with the Moon. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SEE BOTH TOGETHER, as the direction of the moon is always above you not the Taj Mahal. It is better recommended to view it from the Taj View Point which is ok the other side of Taj Mahal across the river
- You can barely see the Taj Mahal clearly
- They are always late by 15mins of the 30mins slot that you have booked
- The ids and tickets are checked on the Taj East Gate Road itself and they take you in the golf carts till the entry point where they scan your tickets and collect your smartphones
- You are safe and under good security, enough to feel like a govt. officer.

For 500 bucks it's a waste of money I feel. This photo is a long exposure shot clicked by one of the foreigners with the help of the stairs there

But the way of management was not good. They ask to wear cover for chappals, and that itself is making the place dirty. It is thrown in the taj Mahal only. Security guards behavior was also very wrong.. One security guard was blowing the whistle in our ears.. Literally it was very irritating.. In our group, old people and children were there with us. So were going slowly and she was blowing whistle till we came to exit point and she also used bad words like stupid. Even crowd was not able to manage by them. Travel from the road towards taj Mahal was so long. In evening there is no light also. As security guard was telling kabrastan me light nhi hota..this is the way they are responding tourist. Will never visit again and will also never refer anyone. We really were very exited to visit taj Mahal and went from mumbai.. But had a bad experience. If wanna go and visit do not enter .. In 50 rs you can go till taj mahal. And click the pics..to visit inside taj mahal entry fees is 250 which is waste to visit.

Okay, now after u remove and ask to deposit in the counters, they make another havoc. Those places are the very worst. No lines, no patience among people. No officer controlling those areas.

Therefore, later many Muslim invaders including Muhammad Ghori broke the doors of Taj Mahal and looted it. This palace was many times bigger than todays Taj Mahal and it used to have three domes. Hindus got it repaired again, but they could not protect this palace for long.

Purshottam Nagesh Oak, after doing research on Taj Mahal, told that Taj Mahal was earlier called Tejo Mahal. 700 such marks have been discovered on the present Taj Mahal which show that it has been reconstructed. Its minarets were built much later.

 *price of meat* 

Magadha emperor Bindusara once asked in his meeting:
To solve the countrys food problem

*What is the cheapest item?*

The Council of Ministers and other members were left wondering! Rice, wheat, jowar, millet etc. are available only after a lot of labor and that too when there is no wrath of nature, in such a situation food cannot be cheap.

Then a feudal lord who was fond of hunting said:
Rajan,

*The cheapest food item is meat,*

It takes less effort to get it and nutritious food is available to eat. Everyone supported this, but Prime Minister Chanakya was silent.
Then the emperor asked him:
What is your opinion about this?

Chanakya said: I will present my views before you tomorrow!

When night fell, the Prime Minister reached the feudal lords palace. The feudal lord opened the door and was frightened to see the Prime Minister gone so late.

The Prime Minister said:
In the evening, the king has suddenly become ill, the royal physician has said that if we get two tola meat of a big mans heart then the kings life can be saved, hence I have come to you to get only two tola meat of your heart. For this you should take one lakh gold coins.

On hearing this, Samanthas face turned pale, he held the Prime Ministers feet and apologized and

*On the contrary, he gave him one lakh gold coins and said that with this money he should buy the heart of some other feudal lord.*

The Prime Minister visited all the feudal lords and army officers one by one and

*He asked everyone for two tola of their hearts flesh, but no one agreed, on the contrary, everyone gave one lakh, two lakh, five lakh gold coins to the Prime Minister for his protection.*

In this way, after collecting about two crore gold coins, the Prime Minister returned to his palace before dawn and on time, in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister placed two crore gold coins before the King.

The emperor asked:
What is all this ? Then the Prime Minister told that to buy two tola meat

*So much money was collected, yet two tola meat was not found.*

Rajan ! Now think for yourself how cheap is meat?

Life is priceless, let us not forget that just as we love our life, in the same way all living beings also love their life. But he is unable to save his life.

And man can make every possible effort to save his life. By speaking, persuading, scaring, bribing etc.

*Animals can neither speak nor express their pain.*

*So should his right to live be taken away just because of this?*

*Pure diet, vegetarianism!*
*Human food, vegetarianism!*

The experience was so pathetic. The human are treated like bugs or bees. The queue was completely mismanaged. There were no navigation board or help to denote which queue is there and every one was going haphazardly. There were school children queue but no one looking out. The gate was flooded with people and the crowd inside was huge. Such a historic place of importance and so poorly managed. I am sure the revenue earned per day through the public would be in crores but unfortunately no one to take care of the simple logistics for them. There is quite a distance from the entrance to the entry gate and there are staff hovering around. Most of the staff who were at work were looking completely troubled and rightly so and the remaining staff was with indifferent attitude and did not care. The second mess is at the screening of bags. The bags are lying there and there are 70 - 80 women around that screened bags screaming and shouting for their purses. No separate queue was there for ladies. There are shoe cover which are mandatory but in a horrible stage. Thus your shoe might be cleaner than the cover. Mind you whether you pay thousand rupees or two hundred rupees you are eligible for same nonsense. If you want to thus enjoy don't visit till the same is better organised. It is a shame on us.

If youre reading this, you will obviously go there. So try to go in peak winters, otherwise its hell due to the heat (along with other issues).

Get your tickets online beforehand as its easier. No timing issue. It has multiple gates. The metro station gate is packed with crowds so take an e rickshaw and take the south gate. Official guides are 1800 bucks so people take cheaper ones.

You cant take much stuff inside so get it submitted outside and take a token. The entry queue is the worst hell ever. First you get yourself checked, then put your bag on the belt. Then they put your bags on a table where other hundreds of bags are kept and then starts a big crowd fight to get it checked by security by hand. They will embarrassingly open up ladies/gents bags and purses and check everything one by one. You can imagine how much time one by one bag checking would take! People are screaming and shouting in crowds and fighting to get their bags checked quickly.

There are no canopies or shades. In heat you will burn yourself while walking. The monument is majestic no doubt but only go there in winters. Guides and photographers will make matters worse. They will irritate you.

If you are planning to visit the mausoleum, then skip it if youre not a history buff. The cost of ticket is extra. You cant take pictures inside it. Its not that big. And you have to wait in line to get shoe covers and pay 10 bucks each for it.

Overall its a money making monument with torturous management. If nothing else, at least put some shades around the walking path. Im sure the photographers and guides that are inside are paying hefty bribes to the management otherwise how come they can make their business without paying for tickets etc.

Only go on the weekends (its closed on Fridays). And only go in winters, if you have to!

Problems you might face:

Parking: Authorities including police men will declare Parking Full and direct you to private other parkings. I have place a recent picture where I was redirected elsewhere, but the parking was easily available (I have posted picture of available parking space for sample).

Overcharging of E-rickshaw:
E Rikshaw from private Parking which is hardly 400 meters from Taj Parking will misguide you for exceptional higher charges whereas its 10Rupees per person (I came back on this price, whereas went there at Rs100 for three person).

Electric van is available from Taj Parking to Entry gate for Rs10 per person (one side).

E Ticket: please book E Ticket online so that you dont need to stay in queue. Dealers will surround you to buy tickets and guide from them and they will ensure you to save you from the rush on ticket window, whereas practically when I visited, the window had hardly approx 30 people in queue.

Ticket for Indian national Adult: Rs. 50 for Taj Mahal, Rs 250 if you want to go to the Taj Mahal marble area. You can buy separate Rs200 ticket if you decide it lated from inside the Taj Mahal.

Street Food in all surroundings is pathetic and unhygienic.

Upmarket ITDC restaurant is available near Ticket Window area, well maintained and good food but on a fairly High price as expected from an Elite place.

Buy show cover Rs5/- per pair, only if you wish to buy tickets of Rs250 per person and visit the upper marble area of Mumtaj Mahal.

Try to avoid weekends.

Try to go early morning, to see the best of the views of the Mahal.

There is no peace here, which is ironic, considering its supposed to be a tomb.
The mausoleum section is a complete waste of time and money. The inner sanctum is a large, ugly thing through which you are hustled by armed guards and yelled at if you dare to take time to observe.
The staff are jaded and rude and there is an unnecessary focus on prohibited items when entering the park.

And these passes are even more expensive. Despite the price hike you still need to pay an extra 20 for a footwear cover which the foreigners get for free with a water bottle to go along. Something else that I noticed is that people now started to almost worship the grave and start throwing money in there which of course pays off the guard on point who tells his lungs out when you try to capture whats happening inside fearing losing out on the money.

Well, Taj Mahal is an amazing sight by itself and no words can do justice to the experience of visiting it.

The auto dropped us to ticketing counter. From there we took an electric bus to Taj Mahal Entrance gate. At the main gate the queue was long and at security check, all edible items were thrown out of bags straight to dustbin by security personnel. They did not bother even if the food was for kids accompanying the parents. They did their job. Little one can do. Security could still be good without forgetting the mannerism.

As we walked to the first gate - the real entrance to Taj Mhal, we were swarmed by local photographers selling 50rs a pic! Gone are the days when one could just sit and enjoy the site, or may be it was such only on our visit. We dont know. We took a walk to Taj. Finally we removed our footwear and joined a mile long queue going from one side of the monument to the now closed tomb of Mumtaj and Shah Jahan and were rushed out without much ado.

There were ropes and off limit areas everywhere we went. The real tomb in the basement is now permanently closed to public. Done, we went back to collect out footwear and started our journey back. Once out of the gate, we could not find any electric bus or vehicle to ferry us back to auto stand. We bought some water and walked some. It was growing tiresome because the complex is pretty huge and we had already walked some 3 kms in past 3 hrs. Finally after walking for about 15 minutes we got an auto and went back straight to our hotel.

It was there at the hotel that we realized that we felt way better in the comfort and freedom of the hotel than we ever felt at Taj. As an Indian, i felt much frustrated with the whole visiting experience, so i can understand what the foreigners feel. Its simply not worth it.

I hope someone in the tourism department reads my review and does something to ease the visiting process and make it a worthwhile experience.",8 years ago,2016-10-23T08:10:32,,,null,3,175,3837,1,null,null

*-- taj mahal closed on Friday dont visit.
1- if traveling via Bus ALWAYS take government Bus.DONT take private Bus service you will regret.
*-- also visit Agra red fort which is very near to tajmahal electric auto will charge 10 per person.

3- FREE water facility is AVAILABLE inside taj mahal & its very hygienic & clean.
4- Remember there is commission invovled on each service you take for example you will see conveyance is cheap but the rickshawalas and auto wala will try to suggest you to take some specific persons service BEWARE of it.
5- while returning AUTO & rickshawalas will try you to take to PRIVATE BUS STAND particularly if you want to visit Delhi.DONT take private Bus service its worst you will regret.

Taj Mahal incomparable heritage

The Taj Mahal is an excellent example of Mughal architecture. Its architectural style is a unique fusion of elements from Persian, Ottoman, Indian and Islamic architecture. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with this, it was described as one of the universally praised, outstanding human creations of world heritage. The Taj Mahal has also been declared the Jewel of Islamic Art of India. Unlike the buildings commonly seen covered with large sheets of marble blocks, its white dome and tiles are covered with marble [2] in shape. The tomb built in the center shows the combination of beauty in its architectural excellence. The special thing about the structure of the Taj Mahal building group is that it is completely symmetrical. Its construction was completed around 1648. [1] Ustad Ahmed Lahauri is often considered its main designer.",5 years ago,2019-10-23T08:10:40,,,null,0,14,1181,1,"Wikimedia | (c) OpenStreetMap

Its just mesmerizing. Though people around arent that polite and helpful. First of all, the taxi drivers, they said there is no place near the monument to keep your luggage, so you have to keep your luggage with us and pay extra. When we reached there was free cloakroom near the monument.

Things didnt end here. Inside the monument a so called photographer said he is certified, clicked random photos and charged us 20 per photo and trust me not a single photo was worth it. We had clicked far better photos in our phones. He charged us around 700 for some unwanted photos.

I would like to say one thing, what do you people gain by cheating tourists around the world for a mere 100 rupees. You would earn a little extra but spoil the travelers whole mood and excitement.

Just felt disgusted.

Yes, the building is impressive, but the overall organisation, infrastructure around do now enable one to feel the place. Yes, the government tries to put some measures to prevent the landmark from dust and mud by banning the gasoline transport around or by fighting the plastic, but still - one should squeeze through crowded dirty streets, rusty gates, not talking about the city nearby. Even the history of the building is, for me, quite far from creating a positive mood. The poor girl was giving birth to another child every 1.5 years during her best years, for the 18th time she died and only after that her husband finally decided to build a home for her, and this construction bankrupted the country. I would not recommend coming specially just for a one-day tour from Delhi. Only if you decide to stay somewhere nearby on the way to another place - then you will probably come by early morning, and will have other feelings than me.

Come early 6am during the sunrise before it gets crowded. There are some guides inside are very annoying. Make sure to use goverment approved guides. They can be quite helpful. The maoseleum is quite eerry and the taj is well maintained and clean. One thing I dont like about Taj is once you exit Taj, the surroundings are very dirty and street vendors non stop shouting and follow and harrass the tourist. Authority and locals should do something to make taj a good place to visit. At least make it clean !!! Remember to buy ticket in advance through official government website

It seems like over crowded than usual because It was bakrid and Ekasdashi holiday.. The entry ticket was Rs. 45 per person . There was a long line for entry ...even we had to wait more if we wouldnt have bought entry ticket online. I gave Rs. 200 per person charges to visit inside part of Taj Mahal and near by museum. Inside Taj Mahal there was only 2 tomb ... one is of Shah Jahan and another of Mumtaz mahal. I think it did not worth paying extra money than entry fee. I also got offended by some Muslim boys there.... they were deliberately taking our pictures which was a sad part of my journey. Rest Taj Mahal is really beautiful .

Been here many times since 1971. But the present system is just a waste of money. It is an international monument, yet it is not under the government. I am emphatic about this fact. The online payment of 250 or roundabout you make online. Is just to get to the Base of the Taj. If you want to go on the marble platform you pay another 200 per head to another spurious looking ticket window. There is no net and connectivity of mobile. Making an online payment took a combination of three different handsets. All they provide is a set of shoe covers for 200. The marble platform is in shambles. It has marbles as if with bad quality waste stones.
The worst is there was no restriction earlier to go to the mausoleum inside, now they have partition of aluminium. Where they seek if you are a muslim, foreigner or what. Based on that you are given different treatment.. The fountains outside are not working, Earlier they used to work and look nice in day time.
There is the real burial site of Mumtaz Mahal in a storey below the fake ones. Even people say that is not the real ones. The real ones where water seeps in and drips on the burial site is another storey below. But like everything else it is shrouded in secrecy. The plinth of the monument, as the guide tells you is on ebony wood and it is below the level of the Yamuna ji, as ebony requires water to bear load or it will disintegrate. That means there has to be a lot of structure in between the garden level and the plinth. God knows what all is hidden beneath the ground levels.
But just a visit is OK. You dont need to come here again and again.

A major restoration was carried out at the beginning of the 20th century under the direction of Lord Curzon, then the British viceroy of India. More recently, air pollution caused by emissions from foundries and other nearby factories and exhaust from motor vehicles has damaged the mausoleum, notably its marble facade. A number of measures have been taken to reduce the threat to the monument, among them the closing of some foundries and the installation of pollution-control equipment at others, the creation of a parkland buffer zone around the complex, and the banning of nearby vehicular traffic. A restoration and research program for the Taj Mahal was initiated in 1998. Progress in improving environmental conditions around the monument has been slow, however.

From time to time the Taj Mahal has been subject to India's political dynamics. Night viewing was banned there between 1984 and 2004 because it was feared that the monument would be a target of Sikh militants. In addition, it increasingly has come to be seen as an Indian cultural symbol. Some Hindu nationalist groups have attempted to diminish the importance of the Muslim influence in accounting for the origins and design of the Taj Mahal.",2 weeks ago,2024-10-09T08:10:55,,,null,0,101,144,1,null,null

I dont know it was good time to visit or not but this whole place was superly crowed with people. The line for tickets and line for entry was around 300m in total, there was no systems followed anyone would interfere in line and police will not show any concerns . Proper instructions were given that female and male will make 2 separate line as you about to reach at the entry gate the guard will separate the line for male and female which make things worse and now you finally enters the Taj Mahal you will forget all the suffering you had taken to see its beauty and will be mesmerize by its stunning symmetry but if you still want to enter in Taj Mahal it self to see how its look from inside who have to be in line of around 150 m long.

The fee is extremely high, and always rising. Its 1100INR for tourist with a water bottle included + shoe cover. The place is well organized and we went through security really fast.

We went at 5:30 in the morning to be able to enter at sunrise and it was already pretty crowded.

Tips: the best facade to get less crowded pictures are sides. When you visit the inside just get out from the back. Everyone stays there. Go on one of the side. Its a lot better. Also, to have a less crowded picture of the front. Sit in front of the middle structure where everyone is taking pictures. There is shade and you can just wait so get a good snap.

Apart from this Taj Mahal is having four entrace gates in all four directions. So much discrepancy in ticket fare like for Indians INR 50/- then there is ticket of INR 250/- too and for Foreigners it is of INR 1000/-. And we can see they are earning good amount of money from the tickets but cant see the utilisation of that money anywhere. The paths which join Taj Mahal to the main road there is not even a single street light there and in summer after 19hrs you can not see anything on that paths and is also not safe to travel after 19hrs.

The only negative aspect I noticed when I was at the Taj Mahal was that I saw a guard beating a stray dog inside the palace. All the foreigners were shocked after witnessing that incident because the dog cried out in pain, and I saw his limbs swaying as if his bones were broken due to the severe beating by the guard or perhaps a police officer. As an animal lover, I was deeply shocked and disturbed by this incident, but unfortunately, there was nothing I or anyone else could do at that moment. I sincerely hope that animal lovers in India will take notice of this and work towards helping these poor dogs.

Its beautiful no doubt. Inside the Taj for those who have not seen from pics or videos. As photography is banned. Its only a two min walk inside where the tomb of so called Mumtaz Mahal is placed at the center of the building. It has a history or it has further places beneath the building I am not sure. But we (Indian identity card holders) pay Rs.200 extra to walk this two min and see this tomb sitting admist of hand carved marbles. Rs.50 jus to enter in the garden area. The tickets are hyped for foreign nationals with foreign identity card. Rs.1500 per head. No eatables are allowed inside everything is jus discarded from ur bag before u enter thru one of the gates.

Guides and photographers flock around you as u enter the monument. you will be tired to chase them away of u dont want one.
But u always have one pic clicked there and printed that is stuck on ur fridge or lying on ur photo album as a memory. :)

There are washrooms at one end of the entrance for free. But they are always full and queue goes long way . And there are only three or four cubicles inside the washroom. They hav tried to keep it clean always house-keeping cleans it time to time. But our people make it dirty and dirty. The washroom infrastructure is not maintained. Its broken the fibre doors are falling and thats the way it is .

If u have bought the ticket to go inside the monument. Make sure u have the pair of shoe cover that vendors sell outside for Rs.10. if u dont then u will have to leave ur shoes and walk bare foot and then lose ur footwear if someone else likes it and flicks it.

Im sure lakhs or people are employed with Taj and around its tourism business. Even though there are lakhs of foreign tourists from outside country come to witness this monument, unfortunately the city of Agra is most dirty and poorly maintained.. Especially with litter and garbage and waste all around you in this city. But Taj like a lotus stands out beautifully white admist it.

Last thing. The last 300 or 500 meters around Taj is not allowed to access with cars or taxis. There are tongas or auto rikshaws that carry you from the security check point and then drop u at the entrance. And then back to ur car. U just have to negotiate with the rikshaws for a better price for ur drop.

Beware of the numerous vendors that flock around you selling various things while u walk out of those main gates. Theyre jus those people living around Taj selling some articrafts and photos and making their livelihood.

The feel of having visited Taj in d end will be like - did I come all the way travelling 4 hours jus for this?! But thats the way it is. But its a world heritage and proud of having it. :)",5 years ago,2019-10-23T08:11:00,,,null,0,44,267,1,null,null

It is at its best when you enter from the east gate and you view it through the gate. Looks dreamy. However, few points that could be improved.
When you visit from the east gate side on your own vehicle or auto, you are only allowed until the parking. Parking charges are 100 rs. You can take a golf cart from here which takes 10 rs per passenger but you will also see some carts and autos even after this barrier which offer you a ride for 50rs or less, the point is that they too drop you way before where the golf cart would drop you. A lot of people who did not take the govt golf cart and opted for the personal auto had to walk more than 200 meters, this could have been stopped.
There were a lot of empty plastic bottles lying around which could have been picked up.
When you exit from south gate (opposite of taj mahal), a lot of shops are there for shopping, they will try and scam you but you can get a good deal if you bargain, they almost give you 60-80% discount on asking price if you play right.",3 years ago,2021-10-23T08:11:00,,,null,4,176,199,1,null,null

The harrassment to reach the parking is un bearable. Its pathetic. Lines for ticket purchase are also in bad shape. Post ticket purchase, entering into the Taj mahal main gate is also one of the biggest challenge you will have to face. Legally, government says the ticket is valid for hours from purchase. They should also understand that it takes minimum 1 hour to enter the main gate. The lines are so long that its tiring. Its not well managed. People who pay extra money can enter from exit row. After entering to the main gate, next task is to wait for your family members to come who might are in different line. And there is no waiting area where you can sit down and wait after more than 1 hour of queue. To reach main Taj Mahal building is another challenge because waiting queue here is larger. More than 400 to 500 people waiting before you to reach to the white beauty. Practically speaking, to reach to the main tomb, it will at least take your 2 and half hour of struggle and tiredness. Moreover, you can not even see the main makbara inside the Tomb. So suggestion - buy costlier ticket or take a guide who can walk you down without wasting time in queues.

Carry a lot of money starting from buying tickets , paying the photographers and guide then the shops and restaurants that the guides take you.
Everyone will try to scare you dont get scared. Just read some material on net. no guide is gona tell you more that that. Just use your own camera or mobile to take beautiful photos. The photographers will tell you they know locations all the location they know/use it a bench on the left side. You can use the benches of the right where there will not be any photographers. They will tell no people will come in photos its impossible. Dont pay and hold them to that sentence.

No maintenance, it's even worse during the rains. Measures have been taken only to keep the inside of Taj Mahal neat but as one of the seven wonders of the world, it's extremely disappointing to see the state of maintenance of such a beautiful architecture.
Do not get your tripod or gimbal as these are not allowed. Better to pay for the tickets online rather than staying in the queue for long times.
Also in the online version, we had a child (free for kids less than 15 y/o) accompanying us which should actually be free of cost but the option to select child is greyed out. We ended up paying full cost for the child as well since we had no other option.
The queue gets crowded, increasingly frustrating during hot afternoons - getting tickets online would be the easiest way to avoid long queues.
You can pay for Taj Mahal + Mausoleum (available online) where you can walk inside the Taj Mahal and see the tombs and architecture.
We had taken shoe covers from a vendor outside that allowed us to put these covers directly on our shoes and walk inside.

It was apparently built by Shah Jahan, the fifth emperor of the Mughal Empire, for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631.

Unparalleled beauty, registered as a World Heritage Site
It is said that Shahjahan built it as a symbol of his eternal love for his beloved wife.
It is said that there are many wonderful stories.
White Marble (Marlboro) The beautiful appearance of the pure white marble reflecting the sunlight and changing its appearance during the day and night attracted many people, and it was a truly wonderful space that did not seem like a grave.
The delicate carvings and inlays on the marble are a masterpiece of Islamic art, and are truly magnificent.
All the buildings are symmetrical, demonstrating the architectural techniques of the time and the great power of the emperor.

Registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
It was a masterpiece of Indian architecture, a fusion of Mughal culture and Islamic art!

If you buy tickets at the entrance, there is a small window where you will get free bottled water and shoe covers (so no need to buy from people offering them on the street if you dont want to). You can buy your tickets alone at the entrance, no matter what the people who approach you on the street tell you.

At the entrance, people say they work there and tried to offer free tours, free photos... all scams, of course, so always be careful and refuse anything you dont want to pay for.

There are water fountains inside TAJ, but there are no vendors and you cannot bring food.

Dont take a tripod, drone, cigarette, pen... the list of what you cant enter is huge.

At 2pm, TAJ wasnt that crowded, we were able to take beautiful photos, but when we were leaving at 5pm, the number of people had tripled. It was 35 degrees on the day and there are few shadows.

Inside TAJ you can take photos wherever you want, but some photographers try to convince you otherwise, dominating the best photo spots, as if you could only take photos there if you paid them. Dont accept this, organize your space and only leave after photographing as you wish.

And the gate manager who searches the belongings of Taj Mahal visitors confiscated even a palm-sized plastic fan to block the sun in the heat without knowing why, but people with other items of the same type passed without incident, which made me feel uncomfortable as I thought it was a search without standards. I heard.
Anyway, the Taj Mahal is worth seeing...

We were there one morning and didnt have to wait long at security. We had previously bought the tickets online. Golf carts drive from the parking lot to the entrance of the Taj Mahal. For foreigners, the transfer is included in the ticket price. Nevertheless, the drivers try to ask for money.
Before security checks, foreigners are given free water and shoe covers at a hidden counter. The overcoats are required for visiting the mausoleum. There is a charge to use the toilet in front of the entrance, which is a disgrace given the fairly high ticket prices.
In front of and on the grounds of the Taj Mahal, foreigners are harassed by so-called tour guides and photographers. Its a shame that the police arent doing anything about it. As expected, the well-known photo spots were pretty crowded. So-called photographers constantly want to sell you their services. But I would advise against this. The cameras are so old that today every smartphone takes better photos. In addition, the would-be photographers try to claim certain photo spots only for themselves and try to drive visitors away from the picture section. Here you shouldnt be put off and simply ignore the photographers.
The facility itself is well maintained. But you can save yourself a visit to the museum.

It is said that Shahjahan had the hands of the workers who built the Taj Mahal cut off. But if we go back to the history, even after the Taj Mahal, the people who built the Taj Mahal contributed in building many buildings. Ustad Ahmed Lahauri was part of the team that built a grand building like the Taj Mahal and it was under the supervision of Ustad Ahmed that the construction of the Red Fort began.



If you pay attention to the minarets of the Taj Mahal, you will see that all four minarets are not standing straight but are inclined towards each other. This inclined construction of the buildings was done to prevent the main dome from collapsing during lightning and earthquakes. Some people say that the four minarets are bowing and saluting the dome, that is why they are tilted.

A poem carved in marble. Charm and grandeur, unique, Taj Mahal is the only one of its kind in the whole world. This is a wonderful example of the love of a great ruler for his beloved queen. This monument fulfills the dreams of Emperor Shahjahan and was built in 1631 A.D. It is one of the wonders of the world built in D. It took 22 years to build it. About 20 thousand people worked together on the banks of Yamuna to complete this amazing tomb. The most fascinating and beautiful view of Taj Mahal is visible on the full moon night.
History
The credit for the construction of this amazing marble mausoleum goes to the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who built this mausoleum in the memory of his beloved wife Arjumad Banu Begum, whom we know as Mumtaz Mahal and who died in AH 1040 (A.D. 1630). Her last wish to her husband was to build a mausoleum in her memory that the world had never seen before. Therefore, Emperor Shahjahan decided to build this marble building as told in fairy-tale stories. Construction of Taj Mahal by A. D. Started in 1632 and its construction work was completed in 1648 A.D. It is said that 20,000 people worked continuously for seventeen years to complete this building and to house them, Mumtazabad, named after the late queen, was built, which is now called Taj Ganj and was also built nearby. Was.

Amanat Khan Shirazi was the sculptor of the Taj Mahal, his name is carved on one of the sides of the Taj Mahal. Poet Ghiyasuddin has written the inscriptions on the stone of the tomb, while Ismail Khan Afridi came from Turkey and built its dome. Muhammad Hanif was the superintendent of masons. The name of the designer of Taj Mahal was Ustad Ahmed Lahauri. Its material was brought from all over India and Central Asia and the help of a fleet of 1000 elephants was taken to bring this material to the construction site. Its central dome is 187 feet high. Its red sand stone was brought from Fatehpur Sikri, jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China, turquoise i.e. blue stone from Tibet, lapis lazuli and sapphire from Sri Lanka, coal and cornelian from Arabia and diamonds from Panna. In total, 28 types of rare, precious and semi-precious stones were used in the carving of Taj Mahal. The main building material, white marble, was brought from the mines of Makrana in Nagaur district, Rajasthan.
entrance gate
The main entrance of Taj Mahal is from the south gate. This gateway is 151 feet long and 117 feet wide and its height is 100 feet. Here tourists enter the main complex through small gates next to the main entrance.
main gate
This main gate is 30 meters high made of red sand stone. Verses of the Quran are carved on it in Arabic script. The small dome shaped pavilion above it is of Hindu style and looks very grand. One of the main features of this entrance is that the alphabet appears to be of uniform size from here. The carvers have carved it so skillfully that the big and long letters create the illusion of being of one size.

There are well-maintained gardens of 300 x 300 meters in the form of four gardens spread on both sides of the walkway. There is a platform in the middle from where tourists can take photographs of the Taj.
Taj Museum
On the left side of the above mentioned platform is the Taj Museum. Here in the original drawings one can see the detail in how this monument was planned in architecture. The architect had also estimated that this building would take 22 years to be constructed. Diagrams of the interior show the location of the tombs in such detail that the foot of the tombs can be seen by the viewer from any angle.
On the left side of the Taj there is a mosque made of red sand stone. It is a common practice in Islam to build a mosque near a tomb, as this gives the area a sanctity policy and a place of worship. This mosque is still used for Shukra prayers.

An identical mosque has been built on the right side of the Taj and it is called Jawab. Namaz is not offered here because it faces west, i.e. opposite Mecca, the holy religious city of Muslims. It was built to maintain symmetry
The Taj Mahal itself is built on a raised platform. Four minarets rising from each corner of its foundation provide adequate balance to the mausoleum",5 years ago,2019-10-23T08:11:13,,,null,2,370,599,1,"taajmhl @SunilKmrSanju

This ivory masterpiece, framed by lush gardens, seemed almost surreal. I would wholeheartedly recommend this pilgrimage to anyone seeking to be captivated by one of the worlds most iconic landmarks.
This was our 2nd time visiting Taj Mahal . Right when you get to the entrance , you would think that you've seen it on TV numerous times and when you see it physically, it's another story . I'll spare you the history, everyone knows Moghul Emperor Shahjahan built this tomb after his wife Mumtaz Mahal died . Just imagine this was built during 1631-1658 manually located in Agra .

It is a masterpiece which is difficult to re-create with the same intricacies and finesse.
Not only the Taj Mahal, but the entire area is well maintained with greenery all around and cleanliness is also fully maintained.
When we visited, all the water bodies were without water as there was some cleaning project happening, but still it did not impact the beauty of the giant marble structure.
It is recommended to visit in the first half of the day or early mornings are much better to avoid unwanted crowds and to appreciate the real magnificence.
If one wants to go inside the massive building, there are separate tickets of 200 and 250 and need to buy disposable shoe covers from the counter or lot of hawkers selling it outside for 10 for each pair. Though reusable ones are available too, but they are filthy and smelling. Entry tickets are for 40 each and children can visit for free.
If you get a chance to visit, do not miss the opportunity and show it to the younger generation too.

The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited. The stunning white marble structure, intricate carvings, and the serene gardens make it a sight to behold. Visiting early in the morning allowed me to witness the sunrise, which gave the monument a magical glow. The architecture and history behind this monument are incredible, and the experience of seeing it in person is unmatched. A must-visit if youre in India!

For a first-time visit, the beauty and size of the monument are really impressive. The design and structure are amazing, and its clear why its such a famous site.

Theres also a lot of interesting history to learn about the Taj Mahal, which makes the visit even more worthwhile. Its fascinating to see such an important piece of history in person.

However, I feel that one visit is enough for me. While the Taj Mahal is beautiful and worth seeing, I dont think I would go back a second time.

Overall, I would give my visit 4 out of 5 stars. Its definitely worth going once to see the stunning architecture and to learn about its history.

However, the ticket price for entering the mausoleum is QR 200, which I found a bit high. One thing to note is that you'll need shoe covers or you'll have to carry your shoes in hand, as they don't sell covers inside, so it's best to bring them from outside. There's also a Taj Museum worth visiting, but be aware that its hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, which differs from the Taj Mahal's visiting hours.

The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million) VB The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.

Watch out for the monkeys in the outer compound.

Once inside the main area, amateur photographers will try to guide you to the best photo spots and take pictures for you with your phone.

We had a little old man do it for us (free at first, he never asked for money) at first we reluctantly accepted his help, and were SO glad we did. He knew all the best spots and angles. He took awesome pics and short videos so at the end we tipped him gladly.

Inside the mausoleum was worth the extra admission. The attendants inside will suck you in with rapid fire information, then ask for a tip.

There is a museum to the left of the main area but it only opens at 9am.

It was an effort to get up so early but well worth it to avoid the crowds and see the magnificent Taj Mahal in the early morning light.

Pity about the fountains and ponds being empty. Some renovation and getting them working would have made the main area even more magical and created a nice cooling effect.

But this was a small thing. We were so glad we came.

Unfortunately, the way to go there (the pathway from East Gate smells of pee. Plus once you arrive, a lot of tour guides will follow you and keep insisting you to take them as your guide, even if you already said no so many times. It really ruined the mood. And the vibes of the place.

It should be a magical place because a part of the world wonders, but too many local people who always push to offer something (guides, photographer, postcard etc) will really annoy tourists who are already tired from walking and the honks from the road, and want to just enjoy the place.

Hopefully, in the future, there will be a more organized system for the guides and photographers.

The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million).

The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperors court architect.

This iconic monument is a breathtaking masterpiece, with its stunning white marble and intricate carvings. Visiting at sunrise offers a mesmerizing view as the monument glows with a soft, golden hue. The gardens are beautifully maintained, providing a serene atmosphere. Its an emotional and unforgettable experience, reflecting the timeless love story behind its creation. A must-see for anyone traveling to India!
Ive visited twice, and it never fails to impress. Hiring a guide is worth it to fully understand the history and details. The architecture is almost perfect, with a minor imperfection that adds character. The grounds are immaculate, and the whole place feels magical. If youre in India, the Taj Mahal is a must-visit.
Must visit in the early hours in winter.
The monument looks different at various times of the day, offering unique views. The reflection pool in front adds to its beauty, creating stunning mirror images. The interior is just as impressive with intricate marble inlay work. Be prepared for crowds, especially during peak tourist seasons. Despite this, the experience remains peaceful and awe-inspiring. The nearby Yamuna River adds to the scenic beauty of the location. You can also explore the smaller, charming buildings surrounding the Taj. Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes, as theres a lot of walking involved. Visiting the Taj Mahal is not just about seeing a building; its about experiencing a piece of history and a symbol of enduring love. The local markets outside are great for picking up souvenirs to remember your visit.

It is located in Agra, India, and was built as a mausoleum for Queen Mumtaz Mahal by her husband, Emperor Shah Jahan. The monument is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Mughal architecture and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Last month, I finally had the chance to see this magnificent structure up close, and I must say, it was breathtaking. The intricate details of the building, including the carvings, calligraphy, and symmetry of the design, were simply stunning. The ivory white marble used to construct the building glowed under the Indian sun, giving the structure an ethereal beauty.

As you enter through the main gate, you are met with a massive courtyard filled with lush green lawns, shaded trees, and colorful flowers. Inside, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal is surrounded by four minarets, symbolizing the four corners of the earth, and is adorned with precious stones such as rubies, emeralds, and diamonds.

One of the most remarkable aspects of the Taj Mahal is the reflection pool that surrounds the tomb, creating a beautiful mirror image of the building. The sound of the water flowing in the reflective pool added a serene atmosphere to the already peaceful environment.

Visiting the Taj Mahal was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The attention to detail, the use of rare materials, and the sheer scale of the project make it clear why this monument has earned its place among the greatest architectural achievements in history. If you ever get the chance to visit, do not hesitate - it is a sight that will leave a lasting impression.

Few tips, if you are going via a guide then you can go in the Mausoleum thats 200 each and learn the history but if you are not interested in history then only 45 it will be to witness Taj Mahal and click photos on your own. There are 100s of photographers you can hire one for 50-100 per printed photo. It is actually a treat to visit.

For good experience try getting an online ticket of just entrance not the museum. Once you enter the taj mahal you can buy the museum ticket near the museum only depending on your mood.
Parking : Enough space to park your vehicle
Food : Have something outside in order to roam for 1-2 hours inside as you wouldnt get anything inside.
Things to avoid : dont carry food, drone, tripod or else youve to keep it in a locker which is free and safe.

Guides are kind of fraudsters there they are having chain system, they can go in the premises of Taj will tell you little bit and then book a specific fraud cameraman and then will let you go in a shops where the items are not the worthy but asking for an extra charge and then they will let you go in a specific shop like prachin which is not the good one and they are having all stuff linked and on commissioned basis..it is good to read the books and watch YouTube videos and enjoy the Natural beauty.

The natural temparature of Agra is very Hot and Humid. But our travel was blessed with rains presence.

Took 3.5 Hours to go from Delhi. But if you start late, say after 8 am, traffic will take more time. There will be or should be at least two proper stoppage after the toll plaza if you are traveling with kids and elderly people.

The inside area of Tajmahal is Huge and normally overcrowded on Weekends. It would take two hours or so if you need to have a thorough walk inside and follow your tourist guide instruction. These MARBLES are Awesome and you wont find these elsewhere in the world.

Its good to know that there are different ticket options available for visitors. The 50 INR ticket allows you to access the Taj Mahal complex, which includes the gardens, different gates, and fountains. To enter the main Taj Mahal building, where you can see the iconic white marble structure up close, youll need to purchase an additional ticket worth 200 INR.
Visiting in the evening is a fantastic idea, especially during the summer months when the temperatures can be quite hot. The crowds also tend to be less during the evening, providing a more serene and peaceful experience. The soft golden light during sunset can add a magical touch to the Taj Mahals beauty.
Remember to check the visiting hours and any specific regulations or restrictions that may be in place at the time of your visit. Enjoy exploring the Taj Mahal and creating unforgettable memories!

Earlier the entry ticket to see the entire Taj Mahal was for Rs. 50 for Indian citizens, however in my recent visit I came to know that we have to pay Rs. 200 extra to see the entire Mahal- Rs. 50 just to walk on the Mahal campus and 200 extra to see the main Mahal (total Rs.250). I think there are some pros and cons to it. Because of the hiked fee, we see 50% less crowd on the upper floor than before so, obviously less rush but, on the other hand, was it even necessary to hike the fee? That too from Rs.50 to Rs. 200! Taj Mahal no doubt is one of the Seven Wonders of the World but I still feel Rs. 250 per head is a bit too much. As an entry fee.

Only problem is that the people in charge treat Indians like second class citizens. Im not exaggerating this, i had to literally wait 35 mins in line because the bag receiver wouldnt take my bag.

He only took ladies bags, which is ok but even when there were 3 people remaining in line he said wait another 5 mins. So much of time was wasted on this and had to cut time while inside to fit my busy touring day schedule.

I recommend dont bring your bag, especially if youre from India because you get the worst treatment.

50 rs ticket is needed to enter inside. After that you wait in line for checking. Checking is fast and only takes a little time. To enter the monument Taj Mahal another 250 rs for ticket are charged.

Place is always crowded so it good for vlogging but not for clean pictures as you may no get clean shot of view.

This UNESCO World Heritage site, situated on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, is often heralded as one of the most exquisite architectural marvels on Earth. However, my visit to the Taj Mahal left me with a unique perspective that transcends the typical superlatives associated with this iconic monument.

To truly appreciate the Taj Mahal, one must look beyond its picturesque facade. Its not just a monument; its a vessel of history, passion, and artistic mastery. The Tajs story is well-documented--a symbol of the undying love that Emperor Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. Yet, its upon visiting the site that one can grasp the profound emotional depth encapsulated within the shimmering white marble.

What struck me the most about the Taj Mahal was its remarkable ability to embody both grandeur and subtlety simultaneously. As you approach the main gate, you are instantly met with a sense of awe at the scale and intricacy of the structure. The white marble gleams in the sunlight, appearing to change color with the shifting days mood, as if it has a life of its own.

Inside, the Taj Mahal reveals an astonishing level of precision in its design. The complex geometric patterns, floral motifs, and calligraphy etched into the marble tell a story of artistry that goes far beyond mere architectural brilliance. The delicate interplay of light and shadow, the symmetrical reflections in the surrounding pools, and the echo of silence in the monuments vast inner chamber all combine to create an ethereal atmosphere.

But what sets my experience apart was the realization that the Taj Mahal is not just a mausoleum; its a living, breathing embodiment of love. The love story that inspired its creation is still palpable in the air. Standing in the presence of the Taj, I couldnt help but contemplate the depths of human emotions and the power of love to transcend time and death.

The Taj Mahals uniqueness lies in its ability to transcend the boundaries of a traditional tourist attraction. Its not just about admiring its beauty, marveling at its architecture, or clicking the perfect photograph. Its about connecting with the human experience, understanding the depth of devotion, and contemplating the endurance of love through the ages.

In conclusion, the Taj Mahal is more than just a beautiful building; its a profound representation of love, art, and history. A visit to the Taj Mahal is not merely a sightseeing experience; its a journey through time and emotions, an opportunity to connect with the eternal and universal theme of love. The Taj Mahal is a tribute to the enduring power of love, and it will continue to inspire and touch the hearts of generations to come.

The is something very majestic and also something very sad about the Taj Mahal. I liked the perspective from the fake mosque on the Eastern side towards and from the central door from the real mosque.

It rained twice when I visited, once right after I came out of the mausoleum. My socks became wet and walking in shoes with wet socks became a feeling I associate with my visit. The Taj Mahal is not interesting to see from inside, it feels small, rather dark and does not reflect the clarity that the structure reflects from the outside.

Now, Let me Give you an Overview and Guide you towards your Journey to Taj Mahal from Ghaziabad, India via Road.
Your Journey is of approx. 220 Kms
1- Start your Journey from Ghaziabad towards Noida
2- Take the Yamuna expressway route and while enjoying the route you will reach Agra in approx 2 hours and 45 Minutes.
3 - Park your Vehicle at the Parking which charges you 100 
4- After parking there will be Guided/Electric car drivers which offer you to sit and they will take you to the Taj. But (pighlnaa nhii hai), From Parking the main ticket counter Gate is approx 700-800 meters. So I prefer walking rather than giving them 20/per person for such a short ride.
5- Now you have arrived at the Ticket counter, and you have offline and online both options available from where you have two ticket options i.e General and the Premium one, General ticket costs 50 and Premium costs 200 ( For Indian Citizens ). Here I will prefer you to take 200 ticket if you are interested in Going inside the Taj Mahal.
6 - After getting Tickets done, You will head up towards the security check which includes a complete and tight security. Your bags are checked completely and then you will proceed towards the Entry to Taj Mahal.
7 - Now entry is done, Enjoy and Have Fun 
NOTES:
1- I am giving 4 stars to this Wonder of Nature because of its Hospitality.
2- Parking amount you will pay 100 but it seems like you have parked in Free parking space. I.e. No Proper space, No one to guide where you have to park, Jisko jaha jagah mile waha laga jata hai ek dusre k samne, peeche koi fark nahi padta
3- By general ticket you will think that you will visit the whole TAJ by inside aur outside, but but... Entry inside the Taj is only for Premium Ticket Customers. So choose your ticket wisely otherwise inside you will have to pay 200  more to get the same and that total costs you 250.
4- If possible come with as few items as you can carry i.e to easily pass security checks and save time.
5- Enjoy the Beauty and the one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

To get access to the main Taj you need to pay extra, else the access is denied to get near to the monument, nevertheless you can view it from far as well. Allot sufficient time to visit the place, as theres too much to walk and explore and dont forget to take the best snaps.

As soon as we got to the Taj Mahal, we were approached by a guide who instantly took us to book online tickets and used his phone number to get the online tickets. I advised home we dont need a guide and just want to enjoy the Taj Mahal by ourselves but we were constantly pressured. He then took us to the golf carts, who drive for like 10 meters then stopped and asked us all to pay, then when we got to the security check area they took our bags away from us and told us to go back to the male section and go through the body scanner. Then the police made remarks that other police in hindi that because we were foreigners we should be checked more thoroughly, i asked why as were from Australia and our security is more strict, then they put all my things back in my bags and let us go through. At the first point the guide spoke for about 5 minutes, I stopped him and said we dont need a guide and that he needs to stop pressuring us. I gave him 500 rupees and told him to leave us alone and he started hassling us and said we should have told him right at the beginning, I told I tried to tell you at the beginning but you did not want to listen. After he left us alone, we enjoyed a nice 1 hour walk admiring the majestic Taj Mahal and the surrounding grounds. We also paid the extra 200rupees to go inside the mausoleum but when you get to the entrance then to get the blue shoe cover its 50rupees each.

It is a shame that India has such fascinating monuments, culture and history but it all gets ruined by scammers. The government should get involved and make all these places a better place without allowing scammers to stay active.

I did. Its a phenomenal structure, no doubt about that! But, before actually seeing it myself, I have had seen this place in countless movies, numerous random advertisements and at a lot of other places, that the experience of actually seeing it in real wasnt as wonderful as I thought it would be. Well, thats an individuals perspective of perceiving a thing, I dont want to ruin anyone elses perception.

This place is remarkably similar to all the other mughal architectures that one can easily find in every corner of New Delhi. But there are a lot of things that make Taj Mahal different from all the other mughal-built buildings and architectures. Being a naive traveller and an inexperienced tourist, I could grasp and understand only a few of the things that make Tak Mahal a worlds wonder but I am sure, there must be a lot of other things that make Taj, Taj!

The white marble is the prominent piece of building block used (obviously) and to protect it from getting polluted, which surely is a concern against its preservation, people are required to cover their foot-wears with a covering, which is offered for free at the ticket counter. We were dumb enough to buy it from a local outside the Eastern gate entrance, without knowing that it was given free of cost at the counter.

A tourist guide would be a great company to know about this extraordinary monument in depth. Without an in-depth knowledge of why the monument is considered a wonder, its just a piece of beautifully carved bathroom floor marble. For example, if you dont get yourself a guide, you wouldnt know that the carvings on a relatively thin piece of marble was made possible only when the builders carved each and every design with a chisel like instrument and not with a more convenient tool such as a hammer, because the marble was so brittle that its thinness wouldnt withstand the strong strokes of hammering.

The point is, just get yourself a guide. Bargain hard on the price which they have to offer for their service.",6 years ago,2018-10-23T08:11:25,,,null,1,84,269,1,null,null

If we put this fact aside for a few moments you will not find anything extraordinary in it. The huge queues in which you have to wait for hours just kills the excitement and curiosity!! Also this place is overly crowded with people all the time and is also losing its charm with the time due to the extreme pollution problems !!

So if you are planning a visit there are certain things that you must know !!
1.) Try to make it at sunrise as it is less crowded at that time.
2.) Book your tickets online from the official website of the taj mahal as it will save a considerable amount of time that would be wasted in waiting the queues of booking centre. Also dont forget to carry a print out of the booked tickets with you.
3.) If you dont want to wait in the long queues you may purchase high prices tickets(even indians can buy it if they want to), as there is a special queue for high priced tickets and it is relatively very small when compared to normal queues.
4.) Also, confirm the dates on which the taj mahal is opened at night(only 5-8 times in a year) on the official website, as it looks very beautiful on the night of full moon. It will be worth to watch !!",6 years ago,2018-10-23T08:11:27,,,null,0,90,314,1,null,null

It takes about two hours to take pictures and browse. You need to go through security before entering, and you cant bring a lot of things. Remember to ask the tour guide.

Everyone knows Taj Mahal. But I saw it for the first time. It is very beautiful. The one who has kept it like this even after so many years should be praised the most.
Such a view as soon as you enter. Truly a wonder.
You may face some difficulty in reaching Taj Mahal. Like traffic, route divert and parking. Car parking goes up to 20/hr.
To book tickets, I would say that you should book online only so that you will avoid standing in the queue. I would like to tell you one more thing in this, the normal ticket is 40-30, in which you can only go around the Taj Mahal but not inside the Taj Mahal. For this you will have to pay 200 extra and children up to 15 years of age are free to take them anywhere in Taj Mahal. Means no ticket. If you want to go to Taj Mahal, you will get shoe covers for which you do not have to pay anything extra. If you do not want to go to the Taj Mahal and just want to roam around the Taj Mahal, then you do not have to cover your shoes.

For Japanese people, when they think of India, they think of curry, Dhalsim from Street Fighter, and one of the most famous things: the Taj Mahal.
Since I went on a tour, I left the purchasing of admission tickets and procedures to the guide.
A guide will accompany you to the viewpoint where you can see the Taj Mahal, but you will have to enter the Taj Mahal alone.
Once inside, a guide-like Indian man will give you a brief explanation in English and then ask for a tip, but there is no need to pay.
The guide had warned me about this beforehand, and I was able to understand it by actually facing it.
You can request a photographer outside to take pictures through the guide, but the guide will take the pictures with his own camera (smartphone), so unless you want to use a good camera, there is no need to ask for one. I thought.

Especially when traveling in India. The story in the background is incredibly interesting. The building complex is breathtaking!
You can book a private tour inexpensively. This way you have more peace and quiet and have the tour guide for yourself. I had a chauffeur for the whole day from Delhi to Agra, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Taj Mahal is located in the north of the country. Unfortunately, the chauffeur could hardly speak English, so it was a bit difficult to have a conversation. But he was very nice and took care of everything. I met the tour guide on site, with whom we walked past the long queue. This saved us a lot of time. The guide was very knowledgeable and told many interesting stories about the time when the wonder of the world was created. Meals were also included. We had lunch in a typical Indian restaurant with very good food. Towards the end I felt uncomfortable because I had a very strong feeling that the guide expected a lot more ""tips"" from me. I had already paid for the trip in full and I gave a tip, about 20 euros, but it wasnt enough.
What you MUST AVOID is being taken to a marble factory! Because you only get a short tour of working with marble and then they persistently try to sell you something. This creates a very unpleasant situation from which it is very difficult to escape. The sellers are stubborn and wont let go. That gave the whole trip a bitter aftertaste at the end. Still, it was a wonderful day! I can only recommend it! #enjoylife #veganlifestyle",6 years ago,2018-10-23T08:11:30,,,null,2,173,1816,1,"#LetsGuide Der Taj Mahal ist ein Weltwunder, das man unbedingt gesehen haben muss. Vor allem, wenn man in Indien unterwegs ist. Die Geschichte im Hintergrund ist unheimlich interessant. Das Gebaudekomplex ist atemberaubend!

Man kann sich kostengunstig eine private Fuhrung buchen. So hat man mehr Ruhe und hat den Reiseleiter fur sich selbst. Ich hatte einen Chauffeur fur den ganzen Tag von Delhi bis Agra, im Bundesstaat Uttar Pradesh, wo sich der Taj Mahal befindet im Norden des Landes. Der Chauffeur konnte leider kaum english, deshalb war eine Unterhaltung etwas schwer. Er war aber sehr nett und hat sich um alles gekummert. Vorort traf ich den Reisefuhrer, mit dem wir an der langen Schlange vorbei gingen. Das hat uns sehr viel Zeit gespart. Der Guide war sehr gut informiert und erzahlte viele interessante Geschichten uber die Zeit der Entstehung des Weltwunders. Auch die Verpflegung war Inklusive. Mittagessen gab es in einem typischen indischen Lokal mit sehr gutem Essen. Gegen Ende fuhlte ich mich aber unwohl, weil ich ein sehr starkes Gefuhl hatte, dass der Reisefuhrer viel mehr ,,Trinkgeld"" von mir erwartet hat. Den Ausflug hatte ich aber schon komplett bezahlt und ich gab Trinkgeld, ca. 20 Euro, aber es war nicht genug.

Was man UNBEDINGT VERMEIDEN muss ist in eine Marmorfabrik mitgenommen zu werden! Denn man bekommt da nur eine kurze Fuhrung in die Arbeiten mit Marmor und dann wird beharrlich versucht einem etwas zu verkaufen. Dadurch entsteht eine sehr unangenehme Situation, aus der man sich sehr schwer heraus retten kann. Die Verkaufer sind hartnackig und lassen nicht los. Das gab dem ganzen Ausflug einen bitteren Nachgeschmack am Ende. Dennoch war ein wunderschoner Tag! Ich kann das nur empfehlen! #enjoylife #veganlifestyle",null

Because if it were not for love, the world would have been robbed of a good example on which people base their relationships. It is an example of how deeply a man loves his wife, that even when she remained but a memory he made sure that this memory would never fade away. This man was the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who was head-over-heels in love with his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. He was a Muslim Persian princess (her name before marriage was Arjumand Banu Begum) and was the son of the Mughal emperor Jahangir and grandson of Akbar the Great. It was at the age of 14 that he met Mumtaz and fell in love with her. Five years later in 1612, they married.
Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahans inseparable companion, died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. It was to the memory of his beloved wife that Shah Jahan built a magnificent monument as a tribute, which we know today as the Taj Mahal. The construction of Taj Mahal started in the year 1631. Highwaymen, stone bowls, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome makers and other artisans were sought after from all over the empire and also from Central Asia and Iran, and it took almost 22 years of love to create what we see today. , it used the services of 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. The monument was built entirely of white marble, which was brought from across India and Central Asia.

The construction of the monument started in 1632 AD and was completed around 1653 AD. While there is much debate as to who designed the monument, it is clear that the monument was built by a group of skilled designers and craftsmen who were accompanied by Ustad Ahmed Lahuri, who is the leading candidate to be the original designer of the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal (sometimes simply referred to as the Taj) is considered a striking example of Mughal architecture, combining Persian, Turkish, Indian and Islamic architecture. Although the white marble domed royal mausoleum is the most admired, the Taj Mahal is actually a complex monolithic structure as a whole. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

The Taj Mahal is about 73 meters high, architected by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, a type of Mughai architecture. It was built on the wishes of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jahangirs son, as a mausoleum for his Persian wife, Arjumand Banu Begum, also known as Mumtaz-ul-Zamani or Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan, emperor of the Mughal Empire had great wealth during his heyday. In 1631 his third and most beloved wife died while giving birth to his daughter Gauhara Begum, their 14th child. At first glance, the Taj Mahal building looks like a large mosque complete with a large white dome. In fact, the Taj Mahal is a burial site. It cannot be denied that Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal with all his heart. The building, which covers an area of   42 hectares, is equipped with a large dome 73 meters high surrounded by 4 smaller domes around it. Meanwhile, the tomb is covered with white marble, Arabic calligraphy writing, as well as 28 types of semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli, marble, jade and crystals combined in a beautiful floral design. With all its luxurious details and designs, it is not surprising that the construction of the Taj Mahal took so long. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and was only completed in 1653. Unfortunately, this emperor had a sad end to his life. The reason is that nine years before he died, Shah Jahan fell ill. Instead of being sad, Shah Jahans children were busy fighting for power. When the emperor recovered, his two sons from Mumtaz Mahal, namely Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, quarreled over the throne. Shah Jahan sided with Dara Shikoh even though his son ultimately died at the hands of Aurangzeb. It didnt stop there, after killing his brother, Aurangzeb also overthrew Shah Jahans power in 1658 and imprisoned his father in Agra Fort for life. In the last years of his life, Shah Jahan could no longer visit the Taj Mahal, which was also the final resting place of his beloved wife. The only thing he could do was look at the Taj Mahal from a distance through the small gap in his prison. The Taj Mahal is a silent witness to the love between the emperor and his faithful wife, who he loved the most. Later the Emperor was buried next to his most beloved wife.

Dibangun atas keinginan Kaisar Mughal Shah Jahan, anak Jahangir, sebagai sebuah musoleum untuk istri Persianya, Arjumand Banu Begum, juga dikenal sebagai Mumtaz-ul-Zamani atau Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan, kaisar dari Kekaisaran Mughal memiliki kekayaan yang besar selama masa kejayaannya. Pada 1631 istri ketiganya dan merupakan istri yang paling dicintainya wafat sewaktu melahirkan putrinya Gauhara Begum, anak ke-14 mereka. Sekilas bangunan Taj Mahal tampak seperti sebuah masjid besar lengkap dengan sebuah kubah putih besar. Nyatanya Taj Mahal adalah sebuah tempat pemakaman. Tidak bisa dipungkiri, Shah Jahan membangun Taj Mahal dengan sepenuh hatinya. Bangunan dengan luas mencapai 42 hektar itu dilengkapi dengan kubah besar setinggi 73 meter dikelilingi oleh 4 kubah yang lebih kecil disekitarnya. Sedangkan bagian makam dilapisi dengan marmer putih, tulisan kaligrafi Arab, juga 28 jenis batu semi mulia seperti batu lapis lazuli, marmer, giok, hingga kristal yang disatukan dalam desain bunga yang indah. Dengan semua detail dan desainnya yang mewah, tidak heran jika pembangunan Taj Mahal memakan waktu lama. Pembangunan Taj Mahal dimulai pada tahun 1631 dan baru selesai di tahun 1653. Sayangnya kaisar ini memiliki akhir hidup yang menyedihkan. Pasalnya sembilan tahun sebelum meninggal, Shah Jahan jatuh sakit. Bukannya bersedih, anak-anak Shah Jahan justru sibuk memperebutkan kekuasaan. Ketika sang kaisar sembuh, dua anaknya dari Mumtaz Mahal yaitu Dara Shikoh dan Aurangzeb, bertengkar karena tahta. Shah Jahan memihak Dara Shikoh meski akhirnya putranya itu tewas di tangan Aurangzeb. Tidak sampai di situ, usai membunuh saudaranya, Aurangzeb juga menggulingkan kekuasaan Shah Jahan pada tahun 1658 dan memenjarakan ayahnya tersebut di Benteng Agra seumur hidup. Di tahun-tahun terakhir hidupnya, Shah Jahan tidak bisa lagi mengunjungi Taj Mahal yang juga menjadi tempat peristirahatan terakhir sang istri tercinta. Satu-satunya yang dia bisa lakukan adalah memandang Taj Mahal dari kejauhan melalui celah kecil yang ada di penjaranya. Taj Mahal adalah saksi bisu cinta kasih antara sang kaisar dengan istrinya yang setia, yang paling dikasihi. Belakangan Sang Kaisar dimakamkan bersebelahan dengan istri yang paling dicintainya.

I remember that some Spanish women were fighting over who was going to take photos first, hahahaha I didnt even wait 5 minutes, but she was very offended by the others, I feel sorry for them, its funny how people who think they are spiritual go to India and behave like shit, they ruin with their ridiculous behavior
Honestly, I dont recommend going at dawn, there is so much pollution and fog that you cant see anything, I went at 9 AM and it was fine

Its quite crowded but you get seconds of privacy sometimes.

Lo recomiendo completamente y hay que fijarse que hay que sacar los tickets hacia la otra direccion que la entrada principal, en una especie de colegio, es curioso pero bueno. No hay demasiada fila, pero tened cuidado porque no dejan entrar casi nada hay que dejar bolsos y de todo en la entrada, lo que recomienso es llevar el movil solamente y la camara para hacer fotos.


Esta bastante lleno de gente pero se logran segundos de intimidad a veces.


Lo que me disgusto es que esta muy cuidado pero los alrededores son pobrisimos, sucisimos y super mal cuidados, sin ir mas lejos al otro lado del rio (asqueroso por cierto) se ve todo horrible.


Como dice la gente, lo que peor sabor te queda, es que no se controla la entrada y que te digan que no se puede pagar con tarjeta de credito es lo mas lamentable que se puede oir y da una imagen malisima del pais.",null

Each quarter of the 300m x 300m garden is divided into 16 flower gardens using raised walkways. A tall marble stone water tank is placed between the shrine and the doorway and the garden, and a north-south rectilinear tank that reflects the Taj Mahal. Apart from this, the garden has several tree-lined avenues and fountains.

Charbagh gardens were first built in India by the first Mughal emperor Babur, which was designed in the style of Persian gardens. Charbag means that the garden of heaven will be reflected. A Persian mystic in writings of the Mughal period described the Garden of Heaven as an ideal garden, filled with abundance. Water or water plays a major role in this narrative. In that text, four rivers arose from a mountain in the middle of the garden of heaven, and they flowed separately to the north, south, east and west of the garden.

Walking path along the linear chowbachar

Almost all Mughal charbaghs are quadrangular in shape, with a shrine or camp in the center of the garden. But the Taj Mahal is different from the others in this respect because its mausoleum is located at one end of the garden instead of being in the middle of the garden. The newly discovered Mahtab Bagh on the other side of the Yamuna River offers a glimpse of a different story, the Yamuna River was incorporated into the design of the garden to make it meaningful as a river of heaven.

The layout of the garden and its architectural features such as its fountains, brick or marble paths and flower beds with geometric brick lines are very similar to Salimar and the sequence was designed by the same engineer, Ali Mardan.

Later on garden roses, daffodils, various fruit trees and other plants are known to be abundant. With the subsequent decline of the Mughal emperors, the gardens also declined. During the British rule, the British took over the maintenance of the Taj Mahal. They transformed this natural landscape to give it the appearance of a new London formal garden.

other buildings

The main gate of the Taj Mahal

The Taj Mahal grounds are surrounded on three sides by sandstone fort-like walls. There is no wall on the river side. Outside these walls are other tombs, including the tombs of Shah Jahans other wives and a large tomb of Mumtazs favorite attendants. These structures, mainly made of red sandstone, look like typical small Mughal tombs of the time.

The inner (garden) walls are pillared and roofed. which was commonly seen in Hindu temples and later carried over to Mughal mosque designs. The walls are connected by peculiar domed buildings overlooking several places, which were used as observation posts. which is currently being used as a museum. The main entrance to the Taj Mahal is also made of marble. The design and style of the door is reminiscent of the architecture of the Mughal emperors. Its arches are shaped exactly like tomb arches and its pistachio arches are matched with calligraphy designs of tombs. Its roof is designed like other sandstone buildings, with beautiful geometric shapes.

Design inside the answer

At the far end of the square are two large sandstone buildings with open sides towards the tomb. Their backs are parallel to the east and west walls.

Taj Mahal Mosque

The two buildings look like exact mirror images of each other. The building on the eastern side is the mosque, the other is the Jawab (North), whose main purpose was to keep the balance (used to house guests during the Mughal period). The answer is different not only in its mehram and its floor design where the floor of the mosque is marked with black stone for 569 worshipers to pray.

The basic design of the mosque is similar to other buildings built by Shah Jahan. Especially his Masjid-e-Jahannuma or Delhi Jama Masjid--a large house topped by three domes. The mosques of the Mughal period used to divide the prayer area into three parts. On either side of the big prayer area is a small prayer area. Each prayer area in the Taj Mahal has a huge dome over it but the area is open.

The construction of the building was completed in 1643 AD.",5 years ago,2019-10-23T08:11:38,,,null,1,70,253,1,"taajmhler saamner ctbre ektti bdd' caarbaag (mughl baagaan puurbe caar aNshe bibhkt thaakt) kraa hy'echil /  300 mittaar X 300 mittaar jaay'gaar baagaaner prti cturthaaNsh uNcu pth bybhaar kre bhaagguloke 16tti phuler baagaane bhaag kraa hy' /  maajaar aNsh ebN drjaar maajhaamaajhi aNshe ebN baagaaner mdhykhaane ektti uNcu maarbel paathrer paanir caubaaccaa bsaano aache ebN uttr-dkssinne ektti srlraikhik caubaaccaa aache yaate taajmhler prtiphln dekhaa yaay' /  echaadd'aa baagaane aaro besh kichu bRkssshobhit raastaa ebN jhrnaa aache / .

Review:

The Taj Mahal is a breathtaking testament to the power of love and human ingenuity. Its intricate marble facade, adorned with delicate floral carvings and calligraphy, is a sight to behold. The symmetrical design and the play of light and shadow create a mesmerizing atmosphere.
While the crowds can be significant, especially during peak tourist seasons, the experience is still unforgettable. The early morning hours offer a more serene and less crowded visit, allowing you to truly appreciate the monuments beauty.
A guided tour can provide valuable insights into the history and architecture of the Taj Mahal. Dont miss the opportunity to explore the surrounding gardens, which are equally stunning and offer a peaceful respite from the bustling city.

Tips for visitors:
* Plan your visit: Consider visiting during the off-peak seasons (November to February or July to August) to avoid large crowds.
* Dress appropriately: Modest clothing is required, and avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless tops.
* Carry necessary items: Bring sunscreen, water, and comfortable shoes.
* Respect the monument: Adhere to the rules and regulations, and refrain from touching the marble surfaces.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is a must-see destination for anyone visiting India. Its timeless beauty and historical significance make it a truly unforgettable experience.

The whole experience was incredible! The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and its intricate details are mesmerizing. For the best and most scenic views, visit either early in the morning or in the evening when the light creates a stunning atmosphere. A few tips: avoid bringing luggage or large bags, as they must be checked or stored in a locker. Keep in mind that Fridays are a holiday, so plan accordingly.

When I saw the dome of the Taj Mahal from outside before entering the main gate, it was a once-in-a-lifetime moment that was truly unforgettable. Words cannot express the beauty of that sight.

It is surreal when you enter from the main gate and see the Taj Mahal receding from your sight, The view was truly magnificent. Once inside, I sat on the floor and gazed at the Taj Mahal for over an hour without moving.

However, the place was overcrowded with many .People were striking funny poses for photographers. One funny example is trying to imitate the famous pose of raising one hand and touching the tip of the Taj Mahal .

Despite this, the Taj Mahal offers a variety of experiences - from a sense of peace when ignoring the chaos around you, to moments of joy when observing the surroundings, and even situations that could potentially make you angry. It is a place where you can never feel bored.

Although I am not sharing my experience with scammers around the Taj Mahal because everyone might be aware of that issue.

As you approach the monument, its stunning white marble facade shines brilliantly against the blue sky, creating a breathtaking sight. The intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones tell a story of exquisite craftsmanship that leaves you in awe.

Inside, the serene atmosphere and the beautiful central dome add to the monuments allure. The surrounding gardens provide a peaceful setting for reflection and photography, making it a perfect spot to appreciate the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Visiting at sunrise or sunset is particularly magical, as the changing light casts a warm glow on the marble. Its important to arrive early to avoid the crowds and fully enjoy the experience.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument; its an unforgettable experience that captures the heart and imagination. A must-visit when in India!

I visited the Taj Mahal between 10 AM and 12 PM. While the monument itself is breathtaking, I realized this might not be the best time to visit. Early mornings or evenings are probably more pleasant as it was quite sunny during my visit.
A quick note on the tickets: there are two options - 50 and 250. The 250 ticket includes access to the mausoleum, but personally, I didn't find it worth the extra cost. Overall, a must-visit, but plan your timing and ticket choice accordingly!

Telling me that the waiting time to go in might take 45 - 60 mins.
If I use him, no waiting time and everything will be express. He quoted me 1800 rupee and it was raining at that time. Wanted to use him but in the end , he bought me to a parking place that need to pay 100 rupee and after that I decided not to because before he told me that parking is free.

After that , I managed to park at the area where the electric bungee were and paid 20 rupee for the bungee to get in to the ticket counter. Upon arriving at the parking , there are a lot more guides knocking at my door.
Some charges 200 rupee to get tickets for me.
Some asking for 500 rupee as a guide. But I had rejected all and took the bungee in.
There was no Q at all at the counter and the process was fast.
A lot of people there trying to be nice to help me guide the way , sell umbrella , rent , or even pass me the umbrella but after that wanted me to go to their shops.
But I had rejected all and decided to just walk in the rain.
Process for checking the bags and body checks was chaotic. No food allowed , I had sweets in my bag and was asked to throw. I had a talisman that I bought at leh which was forbidden to bring in and I threw it away during the check too.
After that , it's the walk and the majestic view.
Its was raining and windy.
And I think that there would be more people if there was no rain.
When everything is finish , going back out , I got to face the shops owners asking me to go in their shops and the waiting for the bungee ride are in a mess.
But somehow I managed to get up 1 and this time I didn't pay anything. I don't know why.
But I am grateful that I am able to witness everything and was safe.
Hope I can help people who want to come here to understand more of how the process is like.
And the ticket is 1300 rupee including the walk in the museum. I advise to get them too rather then just paying 1100 rupee to go in.

Early for the sunrise. No queues as such.
Electric vehicles from the drop off point to the entry point. Buy tickets and then through security screening. Double check the list of things you cannot bring in.
As a group, we got a photographer who took all of our group photos. Cost is IDR$100 per photo or in bulk deal and you get paper photo and electronic copy as well.
Both the long distance wide angle photo and from the Diana seat. Well worth it.
We chose to go barefoot on the marble instead of wearing the shoe covers. It felt so good to be walking on such hallowed grounds in bare feet.
Awesome and truly amazing place.
Highly recommend to everyone.
Note : There are hawkers inside the grounds who will help with photos or provide artistic guidance for a tip.
Nice to walk around the whole grounds and enjoy the experience.
It gets much busier after sunrise, and is busy all day.

For tickets we purchased online but make sure to buy from ASI website as it will be easier to get in. For night view of tajmahal.. tickets are only available when there is full moon chances. Otherwise it is not available. Must visit place with family and friends. Make sure not to take any food items or plastic water bottles. Can carry Personal water bottles.

Advisable to get tickets online or from the QR scanner for payment available approximately 100m before the turnstile entry gate.

2. Best time is to visit early in the morning. Reach here at 6am and you will find less crowd and low temperature. There are few small shops inside providing water bottles and snacks.

3. For Indian tourists, seeing Taj Mahal from outside costs 50 INR and to get inside it costs 200 INR extra. So in total its 250/-. However there is a small discount for online tickets. You can get the above tickets in two parts of 50 and 200 from the counter or also directly 250. So if one takes only INR 50 ticket to just watch the Taj Mahal but later wishes to also get inside it, he can take 200/- ticket from the counter just outside the main Taj Mahal monument.

4. Inside the Taj Mahal you can go barefoot or with shoe cover. The reusable cloth shoe cover is available free of cost at the counter which is just outside the main Taj Mahal monument entrance. The shoe cover then needs to be deposited in the big containers at the exit.

5. Overall it will take 2-4 hours to complete the tour. The entry starts at approximately 5:30am in the morning till approximately 5 or 5:30 pm in the evening. However the selling of tickets both online and offline may stop early at around 5pm approximately. So at least by 4:30 pm one should reach the place.

6. The outermost entry gate is just at one minute walking distance from the Taj Mahal Metro Station. From this outermost entry gate, it will take 10-45min to reach the actual Taj Mahal by walking. All depending on the crowd and timing of the visit. It took us around 30 min overall including the time spent in the entry line, and also it was our first visit so that also adds to the time. Also we went on Saturday.

7. There are some 11-seater (approx) golf carts that are available just inside the outermost entrance gate for those who dont want to walk. They help you save only five to ten minutes of walking time. So we didnt opt for it.

8. Best time to reach is before 7am or after 4pm.

9. Its closed on Friday.

10. Taking photos is allowed almost everywhere with few exceptions.

11. Food items are not allowed to be carried inside. Water bottles are allowed. Checking of bags is properly done at the turnstile entry gate. However it may be possible to sneak in a toffee or two.

As you approach this iconic monument, the anticipation builds, and the moment you catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels as though youve stepped into a dream. The Taj Mahals ethereal beauty defies words; its sheer size, the intricate details of the carvings, and the symmetry of the entire structure make it a sight to behold.

Upon arrival, you are greeted by helpful local guides, who share fascinating insights into the history and craftsmanship behind the Taj. Their stories bring the monument to life, weaving a narrative of love, loss, and architectural brilliance. They also know the best spots for photographs, helping you capture the magic of the moment.

One of the most thoughtful aspects of the visit is the battery-operated cabs that ferry visitors to and from the parking area. These eco-friendly vehicles ensure that the serene ambiance around the Taj Mahal remains undisturbed by pollution or noise. The short ride through the well-maintained approach road allows you to gather your thoughts and prepare yourself for the awe-inspiring sight that awaits.

As you walk through the grand entrance and the Taj Mahal comes into full view, you cant help but feel a sense of wonder and reverence. The shimmering reflection in the long pool, the peacefulness of the surroundings, and the sheer majesty of the monument create an experience that feels almost otherworldly.

The visit to the Taj Mahal is a journey not just through space, but through time and emotion--a truly surreal experience that stays with you long after youve left.

Bonus : hiring a guide will save you from long queues and the ticketing process.

The park surrounding the Taj is beautifully maintained, with vibrant gardens, walking paths, and a tranquil atmosphere. I was impressed by the history and romance surrounding this wonder of the world. The reflecting pools, fountains, and scenic views of the Yamuna River add to the magic. The park is perfect for a leisurely stroll or a picnic. The facilities are well-maintained, and the staff is helpful. A must-visit attraction in India, especially at sunrise or sunset when the Taj shimmers like a diamond.

Park your vehicle in the government authorised parking and take a golf buggy which charges Rs. 20 from parking to the main entrance gate. Get the tickets either from agents by paying Rs 20-25 per ticket extra or you can get the tickets on your own by booking online through the Taj Mahal online booking portal and that is a very easy process. You have two options to buy tickets either for Rs. 50 or Rs. 245. For Rs 50 you will get entry to the Taj Mahal area but I will recommend you to buy the ticket for Rs 245 which will give you access to enter the Taj Mahal and there you can see the burial of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan and the actual view of Taj Mahal premises.

Pro:
April/May is summer, so there weren't too many people!  We could soak in the beauty without the usual massive crowds

Con:
It's HOT. Like, seriously HOT!  Be ready for the sun and heat, especially if you're there later in the day. Bring a hat or sunscreen 

We got our tickets on the spot --1,100 rupees for Southeast Asian tourists like us  It includes a super helpful tour guide & bottled water 

We got there bright and early at 5 AM to catch the sunrise & it was magical! 

Since it was so early, the place was practically less crowded. As the day went on, it did get busier, so the early bird definitely gets the best views 

Our tour guide gave us all the details about the Taj Mahal's history --from how it was built to all the little stories that made it so special

Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is a whole other level. It's so much bigger and more beautiful than we ever imagined . The surrounding gardens are gorgeous too --perfect for taking a little break in the shade

Afterward, our guide took us to a souvenir shop . It was a bit pricey , and they claimed the items were made with stones used in the Taj Mahal itself. We couldn't resist and bought something, but by the time we got back to home, it had cracked 

Overall, it was such an unforgettable experience

The shopkeeper outside will ask you to buy shoe covers but dont buy it because it is available in the Taj mahal for free.
Tip:- You will not get any sharing auto for Taj mahal or any other monuments in agra so if you are solo then book rapido bike taxi which is cheaper than the reserved autos.

The beauty of the Taj Mahal is truly unmatched, and I had a great time exploring its majestic architecture.

One of the highlights of my visit was the availability of a cameraman who can take stunning photos for you, making it easy to capture those perfect memories. I even shared some of my photos, and they turned out great! However, I found the ticket price to enter the mausoleum a bit expensive, so I wouldnt recommend going inside unless youre very keen on seeing the interiors.

For those worried about staying hydrated, theres good news! You can get Pune water inside the premises as long as you have a water bottle with you.

Overall, it was a memorable trip, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Just be mindful of the additional costs if youre planning to explore every aspect of the site.

Built with bricks and covered with marble with some beautiful in lay work with semi precious stone material. This form of art is still practised and the products are available in Agra. The symetery of the architecture and certain optical illusions are amazing. Taj appears different at dawn, dusk, in bright sunlight and on full moon nights, Definitely worth adding to the bucket list make sure you carry just your phone and wallet. Bags are not allowed, and you will need disposable shoe covers by the ticket, which includes the mausoleum . Just outside, there are a few souvenir shops . My advice would be by a thing if you feel it is worth it, and then don't compare prices.

The entry process has two main fees: 50 to enter the first gate and an additional 200 to go inside the Taj Mahal itself. Its essential to be cautious when dealing with guides. Many can be pushy, and some might try to overcharge or pressure you into additional services. If you plan on hiring a guide, make sure to confirm the price upfront and clarify what it includes. After your tour of the Taj Mahal, be sure to pay and settle the deal immediately.

Some guides might try to control your shopping experience by taking you to specific shops where they receive commissions, often leading you to a place falsely advertised as a mini Taj Mahal. These shops typically sell overpriced items. To avoid this, be firm in your choices and opt for exploring local markets on your own if possible.

The Taj Mahal is undoubtedly worth the visit, but a little caution can go a long way in ensuring a memorable experience.

As the first rays of the sun gently kiss the pristine white marble, the entire monument seems to radiate with a soft, golden light. This moment, fleeting and delicate, gives the Taj an ethereal beauty, as if its floating in a dreamlike world. The cool morning air adds to the serenity, allowing visitors to absorb the grandeur of this architectural masterpiece in peace and reflection.

The symmetry of the Taj Mahal, with its majestic domes and minarets, stands in stark contrast to the quiet of the early hours. There's a stillness, broken only by the songs of birds and the soft murmur of the Yamuna River in the distance. The marble's intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones sparkle subtly, enhanced by the soft sunlight, and every detail comes alive under this natural glow.

Seeing the Taj Mahal at dawn is more than just a visual experience; it's deeply emotional. The monument, built as a testament to Shah Jahan's undying love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, evokes feelings of timelessness, loss, and beauty. As the sun continues to rise, the colors of the sky shift from pale blues to warm oranges, wrapping the Taj in a soft embrace that seems almost heavenly.

To truly understand the allure of the Taj Mahal, one must experience this sacred moment. It's not just a wonder of architecture but a place where nature and artistry come together, leaving you with a sense of awe and peace that lingers long after the sun has fully risen.

As one of the Seven Wonders of the World, it truly lives up to its reputation. The beauty and serenity of the Taj Mahal are unparalleled--its a sight to behold and a peaceful retreat.

The security is tight, which is reassuring given the number of visitors. The complex is well-maintained, though it can get crowded, especially with photographers trying to capture the perfect shot. It costs 30 for a single photo, and you might end up spending quite a bit if you want multiple shots.

Entry to the Taj Mahal costs 50, and if you want to visit the tomb inside, theres an additional charge of 250. Despite these costs, the experience is well worth it. The majesty of the monument and the historical significance make it a must-visit for anyone traveling to India. Highly recommended for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply appreciating an iconic piece of heritage!

Dont take guide.. if u want take then for 300 to 400.. also Avoid professional photographers unless u wanted a printed photo.. i paid about a lot(only for soft copies) and then came to know that they cheated me.. they didnt accept for less than 10 photos. And they charge 40 rs for each photo.. seems 20 rs is reasonable for soft copy as they are taking more photos.. my phone camera quality was actually good... I should have considered photographers when i exit the taj mahal.. they were very rude also...

There s a museum inside the campus.. you can find very interesting things used by moghuls.. i liked the plate that turns color or breaking into pieces when it is exposed with poisonous food.

Car parking 100 rs.. take 20 rs battery operated car for 1km ride to reach the main gate.. get tickets online if possible..

There is a clock room to keep things.. food items are not.allowed.. selfie sticks are also not allowed..

Purchase shoe cover for 10 rs for mausoleum visiting.. photography is prohibited inside mausoleum..

Visiting the Taj Mahal was an unforgettable experience. This iconic monument lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places in the world. Here are my thoughts:

1. Architectural Beauty:
The Taj Mahal's architecture is simply breathtaking. The white marble seems to glow, especially at sunrise and sunset. The intricate carvings and the perfect symmetry make it feel like a work of art. The dome and the four surrounding minarets are an impressive sight up close.

2. Emotional Connection:
Knowing the history behind the Taj Mahal, built as a symbol of love by Emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, added a deeply emotional layer to my visit. It feels more than just a building--it's a tribute to eternal love and devotion, which made the experience even more meaningful.

3. Serene Surroundings:
The gardens and the reflection pool surrounding the monument create a peaceful atmosphere. Despite the crowds, I found moments of quiet where I could simply appreciate the beauty and calmness of the environment.

4. Crowds and Experience:
The Taj Mahal can get quite crowded, especially during peak times. However, even with the number of people, the beauty of the place shines through. I would recommend visiting early in the morning to avoid large crowds and enjoy a more peaceful experience.

5. Overall Impressions:
Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or simply want to witness one of the wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It's a timeless monument that captivates you from the moment you step inside the gates. I left feeling inspired and moved by both its beauty and the story behind it.",a week ago,2024-10-16T08:11:46,,,null,0,12,2,1,null,null

However, the crowd situation has improved recently, and it's not as crowded as it used to be. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting between 9 am and 12 pm when it's less crowded.
I recommend buying tickets online in advance. This will save you time and ensure a smoother entry.
There are two value tickets for Indians: one for appreciating the view from the garden area (Rs 50) and another for exploring the tombs from upstairs and inside (Rs 250).
Additionally, there's a higher value ticket (Rs 1300) that allows you to avoid the crowd at the main entry.

Built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this UNESCO World Heritage site is often regarded as the epitome of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles seamlessly.

The first sight of the Taj Mahal is breathtaking. Its pristine white marble facade glistens under the sun, reflecting in the pool that runs along the front gardens, creating a picture-perfect view.
The symmetry, intricate carvings, and inlay work of semi-precious stones make it a masterpiece of art and craftsmanship. The central dome, flanked by four smaller domes and four slender minarets, creates an awe-inspiring silhouette against the sky.
Inside the mausoleum, the artistry continues with delicate marble lattice screens and intricate pietra dura (stone inlay) work. The serene interior houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, surrounded by a peaceful ambiance that invites quiet reflection.
The surrounding gardens, known as the Charbagh, are beautifully landscaped and provide a serene setting to enjoy the beauty of the monument from different angles.

The Yamuna River flowing behind the Taj Mahal adds to its tranquility, especially at sunrise and sunset when the monument takes on different hues, from soft pink to golden and pearly white.The experience of visiting the Taj Mahal is further enriched by knowledgeable guides who provide insights into its history, architecture, and the poignant love story behind its creation. Despite the crowds, the monuments beauty and historical significance make it worth the visit.
Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument but an experience that leaves visitors spellbound by its beauty, historical significance, and the timeless love story it represents. A visit to India would be incomplete without witnessing this wonder of the world.

No pictures do justice to it at all. A true wonder of the world. Hope the government invests some money to clean the marble facade like it did during the pandemic lockdown.

Some tips for the visit:

a. Indian or not, definitely take a guide, each and every story is worth listening to and you will find a guide at Rs. 400-500

b. For some reason they do not allow mobile phone chargers. They dont allow power banks too. Cell phones are allowed.

c. Buy a foot cover if you are planning to enter the mausoleum. Definitely suggest buying tickets online to avoid the queues.

d. Take your time and dont fall for hawkers around the monument. 99% of the stores around the monument are frauds, they sell fake marble, leather etc. If you need a souvenir, ask for the UP Govt Handloom and gift stores

Guide is worth if you get a good one. Go before 11 am, as early as possible. It got very hot very quickly. In October. Apparently it's open on full moon nights, but not inside. Oh and tickets can be bought online, and there too with a scanner instead of standing in line.

Do not waste your money on the shops inside, they sell the same things on the street unless you want to invest in a piece of furniture or something big. Outside you can bargain. Overall a memorable experience. What an amazing mesmerising piece of history.

Taj is breathtaking. It is cleverly hidden from the view when you approach it either from the West gate or the east gate. It is only when you cross the red stone entry gate (which is beautiful on its own) that it suddenly appears in its full grandeur. One cannot help but take out a camera and click a few dozen pictures.

A couple of tips for first time visitors

1. Try to take the early morning ticket. The morning entry begins 30 minutes before sunrise and it is wonderful to watch the Taj at sunrise

2. Book tickets online. It will save you a lot of time. The tickets cost Rs 45/- for Indians and Rs 1,050/- for a foreigner.

3. If you want to enter the mausoleum its Rs 200/- more per person. Its worth it .

4. The line for foreigners is really really long so try and queue up early.

5. Kids below 15 years both Indian and Foreign, get in free

Your best bet is to go at sunrise when there are few tourists and you will have ample time to walk all over the grounds and take photos. I went there around 8:30 AM in early October, and it was already crowded.
Enter from the east gate. Thats where most of the hotels, restaurants, shops and guides are.
Do get a registered tour guide, but only outside the ticket counter, not from anywhere else. You can negotiate with them.
If you want to get professional photos inside, each hard copy would cost you INR 100, while each soft copy would cost you INR 80. However, the number of pictures you get taken could easily reach 100, so keep that in mind.
Get the ticket for the mausoleum as well, the design inside is stunning.

Additionally, other artisans were also involved in this work, who were his distinguished assistants and helped in various aspects of the construction. This included a team of residential and non-residential artisans, marble cutting artisans, marble artisans, colorful stitching artisans, carving artisans, lighting artists and jewelers. They worked on marble and stone carving, luminous art, tunneling architecture, silver work, colorful stitching and gold work. The beauty, carvings and intricate craftsmanship of the Taj Mahal symbolize the hard work and skill of the artisans who built this great grandeur.

The full name of Taj Mahal is ""Diwan-i-Khas-i-Khusro"". This mausoleum was built in memory of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Mughal emperor Shahjahan. It is also known as ""Taj Mahal"" in English. ""Taj"" means ""Taj Mahal"" and ""Mahal"" means ""mausoleum"" or ""palace"". It means ""Taj mausoleum"" or ""Taj palace"".

Every INTRICATE DETAIL and every WELL MAINTAINED GARDEN around TAJ MAHAL contributes to an atmosphere of PEACE and TRANSIT.

Walking through the corridors and feeling the aura of devotion and respect is a PROFOUND experience.

The view of the YAMUNA RIVER in the background adds a touch of SERENITY to the already perfect setting.

Without a doubt, TAJ MAHAL is one of the WONDERS OF THE WORLD, and its BEAUTY and MEANING leave a lasting mark on the hearts of all who are lucky enough to visit it.

Please, leave lighters and tobacco in the cloakroom which will make you come back: scrupulous checks by the military at the entrance! It is also worth buying the ticket to enter the mausoleum (it is not possible to take photos inside and you enter barefoot or with shoe covers). The visit can be done calmly in two hours. If you stay inside for more than three hours you have to pay an exit penalty.

If I bought it myself, it would have cost 1100 rupees.
Instead, I was told that there was an additional fee to go inside the Taj Mahal, so I didnt go in, but when I saw it later on Youtube, it didnt seem like there was a separate fee. Even after leaving India, I still dont understand.

, I told my friends that we should first ride on the R-cart of the tourist department, but we were trapped in the sweet language of the e-rickshaw drivers. That e-rickshaw driver took us from the West Gate back to the Main Road and then through the narrow streets and dropped us at the East Gate. During this entire journey, mine and my friends knees collided with other e-rickshaws many times. Had they collided, we would have had to spend a few days in the hospital and it is not known how long we would be able to walk properly.
My request to everyone is that the best way to go to Taj Mahal is from the West Gate and to go inside from the parking here, use the e-cart of the tourist department which has about 12 seats. And whenever you travel anywhere by e-rickshaw etc., do not take your feet out of the e-rickshaw at all. Otherwise any serious accident can happen to you. And if you go by purchasing the ticket online, it will be even better, you will not have to stand in line for the ticket.

essay on Taj Mahal

Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people associate India with the Taj Mahal. However, for me, more than the spectacular architecture, it is the story behind it that fascinates me the most. This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of a husbands love for his wife. Furthermore, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for future generations.

Taj Maha - Symbol of Love
The famous Taj Mahal was brought to life from the vision of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He built this memorial for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her death.

To honor the memory of his beloved wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from around the world to create it. He wanted to create something that had never been created for anyone before. The king wanted to give his last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.

It was built in the 17th century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.[1]

Duration: 10 minutes and 7 seconds.10:07
Taj Mahal incomparable heritage
Mughal architecture was at its peak during the time of Mughal emperor Shahjahan, Taj Mahal is the most famous example of that architecture. Taj Mahal is an excellent example of Mughal architecture. Its architectural style is a unique fusion of elements from Persian, Ottoman, Indian and Islamic architecture. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with this, it was described as one of the most universally praised human creations of world heritage. Taj Mahal has also been declared the gem of Islamic art of India. Unlike the commonly seen buildings which are covered with large sheets of marble blocks, its white dome and tiles are covered [2] with marble in shape. The tomb built in the center shows the combination of beauty in its architectural superiority. The special thing about the structure of the Taj Mahal building group is that it is completely symmetrical. Its construction was completed around 1648. [1] Ustad Ahmed Lahauri is often considered its chief designer. [3] It took about 22 years to construct the Taj Mahal.

architecture
Main article: Origins and architecture of Taj Mahal
mausoleum

Map of floor plan of Taj Mahal
The centerpiece of the Taj Mahal is the white marble mausoleum built on a square foundation. It is a symmetrical building, which has an iwan i.e. a very large curved (arch-shaped) door. A large dome adorns the top of this building. Like most Mughal tombs, its basic components are of Persian origin.

basic premise
Its basic foundation is a huge multi-chambered structure. This main chamber is cubic, each side of which is 55 meters (see: floor map, right). On the long sides is a massive pishtaq, or arched-roofed chamber gate. It is connected to the arched balcony above.

main arch
On either side of the main arch, two additional pishtaqs are built on either side, one above the other. In the same style, two pishtaqs (one above the other) are built on all four sides of the chamber. This structure is completely symmetrical on each side of the building, which makes the building an octagon rather than a square, but since the four corner sides are much shorter than the other four sides, it would be appropriate to call it square. The four towers around the tomb seem to frame the view of the building, at the four corners of the original base post. The main chamber contains the fake tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shahjahan. These are very decorated, and their original is situated on the lower floor.

Ive always wanted to go to the Taj Mahal. He finally went. I went early in the morning, so it was beautifully illuminated by the morning sun. The mausoleum is huge and beautiful, and it also has a melancholy feel to it. The whiteness of marble rather than chalk, and the beauty of the symmetry were also wonderful. There is a strict inventory check to enter. You can get water inside. There is a replica grave inside the mausoleum, so photos are not allowed. But since it is a mausoleum, there is only a grave. The Taj Mahal has an amazing exterior that somehow reminded me of Mont Saint Michel in France. The silhouette is also beautiful. My advice is to go during the dry season. In the summer it would be too hot, and in the rainy season it would be cloudy and difficult to see. It seems best to go when its not raining or hot. If its not sunny, the beauty may be halved.

At dawn it is beautiful. A must visit, even though this advice sounds banal.
For practical reasons: you cannot bring cigarettes, lighters, or food with you (everything edible will be taken away at the entrance). Although small nuts would be useful to feed the chipmunks, of which there are many.
You cant even take photos inside the mausoleum, even with your phone, but the carved fence is worth a look. I advise you to ask the attendant to highlight the marble and stone inlay (he does this with a flashlight) - an unforgettable impression of translucent natural stones.

This mausoleum is a mix of perfection and symmetry, it is no coincidence that it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world.
I was lucky enough to visit it twice in the space of three days.

I highly recommend going there at these hours, the colors and lights make everything even more spectacular. Even inside you will be enchanted by the beauty and perfection.
We didnt find much queue at the ticket counter, also because foreigners have a dedicated queue. Entry costs 1300 INR, perhaps the most expensive attraction entry in northern India, but worth it. Absolutely.

Non abbiamo trovato molta coda al ticket counter, anche perche gli stranieri hanno una fila dedicata. Lingresso costa 1300 INR, forse lingresso per unattrazione piu caro nellindia nel nord, ma ne vale la pena. Assolutamente.

Currently, inside the temple, there are two mausoleums of the king and queen. The temples domed roof makes the sound echo like in a movie theater.

As you can see in the photos and videos, it is a very beautiful place, and even now, even after all this time, I am glad I visited.
We had planned to go in casual clothes, but the night before we ended up running a tour guide (there were no other tour participants other than ourselves, so it was essentially a private tour), so both my husband and I wore rented costumes. I regret it a lot. Women are allowed to wear sarees, but men are strongly advised not to wear costumes. 95% of tourists are in casual clothes, so its easy to see.
There was a baggage check immediately after entering the venue, so it was a good idea to keep the minimum amount of luggage.
You can get shoe covers and bottled water a little further away from the entrance.
It was a weekday according to the Japanese calendar, but it was before Duwali, and many people from India were there.
Since it was a tour, I drove there from Delhi. It took about 4 hours one way at high speed, but there were several service areas along the way, so I was able to travel without worrying too much about bathroom breaks.

It is truly amazing to see it up close and you can take some spectacular photos. Lets not forget that it is a tomb so remember that you must have respect and you cannot take photos inside.
Things to keep in mind:
- It is inside a park and to access it you have to walk for a while. There are little trains available but you have to pay. The walk is pleasant and safe but it is about 10 minutes on foot.
- You have to visit it early in the morning around 6/7 ideally. The reason is the extreme heat, especially because the white marble reflects the sun and in summer it can reach 47-50 degrees near the building.
- You are not allowed to bring anything, cigarettes, food, etc. will be confiscated. The best thing is to take your water bottle and cell phone for photos and thats it.
- Be careful with street vendors when you go out!! They are everywhere and there are many people attentive to your wallet.
- It is necessary to pay entry. You can buy it online beforehand to avoid lines.

Es una autentica pasada verla de cerca y se pueden hacer unas fotos espectaculares. No olvidemos que es una tumba asi que recordar que hay que tener respeto y no se pueden hacer fotos dentro.

Cosas a tener en cuenta:

- Esta dentro de un parque y para acceder hay que andar un rato. Hay trenecitos disponibles pero hay que pagar. El paseo es agradable y seguro pero son unos 10 minutos a pie.

- Hay que visitarlo por la manana pronto sobre las 6/7 idealmente. El motivo es el calor extremo, sobre todo porque el marmol blanco refleja el sol y en verano se puede llegar a los 47-50 grados cerca del edificio.

- No se permite llevar nada, los cigarros, comida, etc te los requisaran. Lo mejor es llevarte tu botella de agua y movil para fotos y ya.

- Cuidado con los vendedores ambulantes cuando sales!! Estan por todos y hay mucha gente atenta a tu cartera.

- Es necesario pagar entrada. Puedes comprarla online previamente para evitar colas.

It is set on a plinth, in the corners of which there are four minarets - towers from which the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer. Two identical red stone mosques stand on either side.

I expected it to be beautiful but when you go there it is an experience that moves you. I recommend seeing it with a guide or having it explained well beforehand because it makes the experience 10 times more powerful.

The incredible things are all the inlays made of semi-precious stones inserted into the white marble and the perfect symmetry from all points of view both in the internal architecture and in the entire complex including the gardens, walls and buildings around.

The romantic story behind it is also incredible. It is often told as the story of a king with a beautiful young wife whom he lost at a young age and built a mausoleum for her. In reality it is the story of two boys who have loved each other since their youth and spent almost twenty years together, sharing everything, even the war missions in which the queen accompanied the king.

E incredibile anche la storia romantica che ci sta dietro. Viene spesso raccontata come la storia di un re con una bella giovane moglie che ha perso in giovane eta e le ha costruito mausoleo. In realta e la storia di due ragazzi che si sono amati fin dalla gioventu e hanno passato quasi vent'anni insieme, condividendo tutto, anche le missioni in guerra in cui la regina accompagnava il re.

Doesnt disappoint. I recommend getting your tickets in advance online (you will avoid the queue to buy and you will arrive directly at the entrance queue, which at that time is short). The discount they give is better than the change. With these tickets they give you a discount of 50 rupees if you want to see the Red Fort later. Another option is to take them out in the morning and go just at dawn at 5:30, 5:45 or 6 and enter through the west door. Immediately go to the mosque area. From there, with the sun rising, the photos are spectacular. Next, go to the guest area (opposite side of the mosque) and with a mobile phone on the ground or spilling water on the ground you will get some impressive mirror photos. Then you can return to the central pond to take photos from the canal and finally from the cloisters. from the Darwan gate and at the entrance. The length of stay is 3 hours and be careful that they will constantly overwhelm you for guides, photos, etc. If it is not your plan, say no to everything. Transportation between the west gate and the entrance to the venue is free with admission. Otherwise its 20 rupees per person

Recomiendo sacar las entradas con antelacion on line (evitareis cola para comprar y llegareis directos a la cola de entrada, que a esas horas es poca). El descuento que hacen es mejor que el cambio. Con esas entradas te hacen descuento de 50 rupias si quereis ver el Fuerte Rojo despues. Otra mas, sacarlas de manana e ir justo amaneciendo 5:30, 5:45 o 6 y entrar por la puerta oeste (West). Inmediatamente iros a la zona de la mezquita. Desde alli, con el sol saliendo, las fotos son espectaculares. Seguidamente id a la zona de huespedes (lado contrario a la mezquita) y con un movil en el suelo o derramando agua en el suelo saldran unas fotos especulares impresionantes, Luego podeis regresar al estanque central para hacer fotos desde el canal y finalmente desde los claustros de la puerta Darwan y en la entrada.

This recognition makes the Taj Mahal attract the attention of many tourists from all over the world. This building later became one of the popular tourist destinations in Asia.

Foreign tourists do not only hunt for the wonders of the magnificent Taj Mahal building. They also studied the history of the construction of the mosque building and several other parts that had to sacrifice dark history. To the extent that the story of its creation was compiled in a book which has been translated into several languages   of the world.

The story of the construction of the Taj Mahal is still full of historical nuances of the kingdom in the past. This is different from the history of the establishment of the Monas monument in Jakarta, which is covered in nuances of the struggle for independence and nationalism. However, the Taj Mahal building can be compared to the splendor of the Colosseum in Rome and the Tower of Pissa in Italy. These buildings were jointly ranked as the 7 Wonders of the World before being re-designated several years ago

The history of the construction of the Taj Mahal was classified as a major project of its time. The work involved the efforts of thousands of Indian residents and artists in that country to produce a building full of decoration and calligraphy from the Koran written in Arabic. However, in essence, all these designs were planned by the best architect of his time, Isa Muhammed.

The construction of the Taj Mahal was carried out during the reign of the Mogul empire, a large kingdom in India. At that time the empire was held by Shah Jahan who had a queen named Mumtaz Mahal. From the love story full of struggle between the two of them, the Taj Mahal became a building that will not be forgotten by time.

This magnificent building dominated by white, which symbolizes purity, was erected in the Uttar Paradesh area. Its exact location is on the banks of the Yamuna river, which is one of the holy rivers in Agra, India. The completion process took approximately 22 years.

Shah Jahan really wanted a philosophical monument without losing its beautiful impression to commemorate the death of Mumtaz Mahal after giving birth to his son. There were around 20,000 people involved in the process of establishing the Taj Mahal. They were deliberately brought in from all parts of India, Persia and Turkey to arrange the composition of the building so that it was balanced and according to Shah Jahans expectations.",5 years ago,2019-10-23T08:12:07,,,null,14,19,225,1,"Taj Mahal merupakan salah satu keajaiban dunia yang diakui secara resmi oleh UNESCO, sebuah organisasi sayap PBB yang mengurusi urusan kebudayaan di dunia. Pengakuan ini membuat Taj Mahal dilirik banyak turis dari seluruh dunia. Bangunan ini kemudian menjadi salah satu destinasi wisata populer di Asia.


Para turis mancanegara tidak hanya memburu keajaiban bangunan megah Taj Mahal. Mereka pun mempelajari sejarah pembangunan bangunan Masjid serta beberapa bagian lain yang harus mengorbankan sejarah kelam. Sampai-sampai kisah pembuatannya disusun dalam sebuah buku yang telah diterjemahkan ke dalam beberapa bahasa negara dunia.


Kisah pembangunan Taj Mahal masih kental dengan nuansa sejarah kerajaan di masa lalu. Berbeda dengan sejarah pendirian tugu Monas di Jakarta yang dibaluri nuansa perjuangan kemerdekaan dan nasionalisme. Bagaimanapun juga, bangunan Taj Mahal dapat disejajarkan dengan kemegahan Colosseum di Roma serta Menara Pissa di Italia. Bangunan-bangunan tersebut pernah bersama-sama menduduki peringkat '7 Bangunan Keajaiban Dunia' sebelum dilakukan penetapan ulang beberapa tahun lalu


Sejarah pembangunan Taj Mahal tergolong ke dalam proyek besar pada masanya. Pengerjaannya melibatkan tenaga ribuan penduduk India serta seniman-seniman di negara tersebut untuk menghasilkan sebuah bangunan penuh hiasan dan kaligrafi Al Qur'an yang ditulis menggunakan bahasa Arab. Namun pada intinya segala rancangan tersebut direncanakan oleh seorang arsitek terbaik di zamannya, Isa Muhammed.


Pembangunan Taj Mahal dilaksanakan di zaman pemerintahan kekaisaran Mogul, sebuah kerajaan besar di India. Waktu itu kekaisaran tersebut dipegang oleh Shah Jahan yang memiliki permaisuri bernama Mumtaz Mahal. Dari kisah cinta penuh perjuangan antara keduanya itulah, Taj Mahal menjadi bangunan yang tidak terlupakan oleh waktu.


Bangunan megah dengan dominasi warna putih yang melambangkan kesucian tersebut didirikan di wilayah Uttar Paradesh. Letak pastinya ada di bantaran sungai Yamuna yang merupakan salah satu sungai suci di Agra, India. Proses penyelesainnya memakan waktu sekira 22 tahun.


Shah Jahan benar-benar menginginkan sebuah monumen filosofis tanpa menghapus kesan indahnya untuk mengenang kematian Mumtaz Mahal sehabis melahirkan putra beliau. Ada sekitar 20.000 orang terlibat dalam proses pendirian Taj Mahal. Mereka ini sengaja didatangkan dari seluruh bagian negara India, Persia serta Turki untuk mengatur komposisi bangunan agar seimbang dan sesuai harapan Shah Jahan.",null
