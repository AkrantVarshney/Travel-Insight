really nicely kept up by the authorities. There are guides available to provide information about the jail in both Hindi and English.
An in-depth look at the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters may be had by visiting this location. Veer Savarkars cell number 123 is marked with pictures and personal items to create a sense of belonging. On national holidays, it is closed.

If you can understand Hindi, there are sound and light events starting at 5:30 p.m. that are quite remarkable. we left the show midway since it was not in English. Locals told me that the show used to be English & Hindi, but it is currently only available in Hindi. Im not sure to what extent that is true.

Before purchasing tickets for a show, I would advise finding out the language used during the performance. The shows tickets may be purchased online. we got the tickets in tour package itself.

The show uses the jails facade as a canvas, with lights and narration bringing the structure to life. The combination of stirring narration, evocative music, and visual effects creates an emotional atmosphere, allowing visitors to connect with the stories of courage and sacrifice.

The Cellular Jail in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is a poignant reminder of Indias struggle for independence. This former British colonial prison, now a national memorial, is a must-visit for history enthusiasts and anyone interested in understanding the countrys complex past.

The jails eerie atmosphere and crumbling walls whisper tales of the countless freedom fighters who suffered within its confines. The poignant museum, the infamous solitary cells, and the gallows all serve as a haunting reminder of the sacrifices made by Indias brave sons and daughters.

A visit to the Cellular Jail is a sobering experience that will leave you with a deeper appreciation for Indias hard-won freedom and a sense of reverence for the courageous men and women who fought for it.

There are 3 wings still standing out of 7
A lot of structure is stripped
The photos on display is now blurred and not visible
I believe all the freedom fighters should be equally respected but here only selectively wings and alleys are better maintained
Rest are just there un treated under maintained
A lot could be here but its sad that the government is disrespecting the freedom struggles

We had to purchase the tickets for the museum ( Rs 30 each). This tickets can be purchased any time.
.
This visit may take about an hour. Was very
challenging as it was so hot and all were glued to the huge air coolers in the area.

Lovely to see the structure and learn the past
history of Andamans. We get connected to it all as we understand how the freedom
fighters struggle those days. Nice to the department maintain this place..

Later we had to wait for the Lights and sound show which is really amazing with all the technology and equipment.. This show starts after the sun sets and so the wait.

We knew ( after seeing various YouTube videos ) that in case we dont purchase these tickets ( the price is Rs. 300 per head) a week earlier, one may miss this show. So we were prepared for it. The seats are numbered so we dont have to worry. Please carry your ID card like Aadhaar etc with your tickets!!

We went out to have tea and kept drinking water.

The show is about one hour. Totally worth it to get a gist of the history of Andamans.

This historic site brings a sense of pride and immense sadness as you walk through the corridors where our real heroes endured unspeakable hardships.

The Light and Sound Show is particularly worth experiencing. It vividly narrates the atrocities committed by the British government and the relentless struggles of our freedom fighters. However, theres a strange irony that cannot be overlooked: **after all the graphic depictions of British colonial brutality, the entire video production was done by a UK company, proudly showcasing their brand in the credits at the end. It almost feels like they are waving the Victorian flags once again**.

**Come on, Government of India, let's get it done by an Indian company. After all, this is about being Indian and honoring our history in a manner that truly reflects our pride and independence**.

The whole island administration sucks when it comes to maintenance and cleanliness, and it's sad that we are losing out. This place has all the potential to be a heaven, yet it falls short. 

Still, visit and promote our country

The jail, often referred to as Kala Pani was infamous for its isolation, and it housed many Indian freedom fighters who were considered a threat to the British Empire.
The freedom fighters who were incarcerated here included notable figures such as Batukeshwar Dutt, Veer Savarkar, Yogendra Shukla, and many others. They were subjected to harsh conditions, relentless punishment, solitary confinement, and forced labor.
One of the most emotionally impactful experiences at Cellular Jail today is the Light and Sound Show, which narrates the story of the freedom fighters who were imprisoned there. This show takes place in the evening and is designed to evoke deep emotions as it combines powerful visuals, sound, and light to narrate the history of the jail, highlighting the courage and endurance of the freedom fighters.

If you have difficulty in sleeping  then only watch the lights and sound show it will make you sleep .... Guaranteed. The best part of show is when the The National Anthem gets played( note:- It gets played when show gets over ).
I put the show recommendation in the first place because of what I suffered  and dont want others to suffer.It is such a waste of very good equipment installed for the show.

Apart from that Cellular Jail is must visit for every Indian who wants to feel the souls of people who got martyred in Cellular Jail fighting for Freedom of country (which we now dont recognise).
Its beautifully maintained ( some blocks ). Its chilling  to even think of Kaala Paani prision which was then almost a desolate place surrounded by deep sea faraway from mainland and freedom fighters spending their life there. Visit is definately recommended .

In the middle of the show there was rain. Since the seats are on open air its highly advised to bring umbrella or a poncho. But they could easily make a simple retractable roof to give cover for the audience stuck in open air.

Photos are not allowed during the show but it gives best history lesson. Our respects for all the freedom fighters who struggled and gave their lives to give us this beautiful country.

The 45-minute show is a tribute to the brave men and women who fought for Indias independence and suffered unimaginable hardships within the walls of this prison.

The light show transforms the jails facade into a canvas, projecting vivid 3D images and animations that recreate the era of British colonial rule. The visuals are stunning, with perfect timing and precision.

The ending of the light & sound show is stirring display of patriotism, as the Indian national anthem plays and the tricolor is projected onto the jails walls, every Indian must experience this. Its a moment that will fill your heart with pride.

Please buy tickets for the light and sound show online in advance through the Andaman Government portal.

The place is extremely well maintained - neatly marked areas . Entry fees for Indians is 30 INR. it opens early so either you make the 8:45/9 am entry and then take about 40 mjns to tour the place . This works if you are checking out and have an afternoon flight . Otherwise it's better to do a 3:45 pm entry ( tickets close by 4 - place closes by 5) and combine with the light show . The guides( 200 per family ) will take you around the key locations within the jail and do a decent job of storytelling . The sound and light show has three shows in the evening - every hour from 5;50 pm . Note - different languages on different days ( Hindi , English ) - look to buy online . The show lasts for about 40 mins ( 150 INR) . The audio visual impact is stunning and tells the poignant tale of the jail and the many incarcerated leaders . Overall a must see place.

Stepping into this iconic structure, one is immediately transported back in time, feeling the weight of history within its walls. The architecture itself serves as a silent witness to the sacrifices and hardships endured by the freedom fighters who were once imprisoned here.

The jails meticulous restoration preserves the somber atmosphere, with each cell narrating a unique story of resilience and determination. The solitary confinement cells, in particular, provide a haunting glimpse into the harsh conditions faced by those who fought against colonial oppression.

The highlight of the Cellular Jail experience is undoubtedly the spectacular light and sound show held in the evening. As the sun sets, the jail comes alive with a mesmerizing display of lights and lasers that narrate the heroic saga of Indias struggle for freedom. The narration, accompanied by soul-stirring music, creates a powerful and emotional journey through the pivotal moments of the independence movement.

The synchronized play of lights on the jails facade, coupled with the powerful storytelling, evokes a sense of pride and patriotism. It is a poignant tribute to the countless freedom fighters who endured unimaginable hardships within these very walls. The show not only educates visitors about Indias history but also leaves a lasting impact, instilling a deep appreciation for the sacrifices made for the nations independence.

In conclusion, the Cellular Jail and its spectacular light and sound show offer a profound and immersive experience that resonates with the spirit of Indias struggle for freedom. It is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking to connect with the rich historical tapestry of the country.

this is a national memorial for all the freedom fighters who gave their life to mother India.

this is a very old jail and one of the deadly ones in its time.

some wings of the jail is converted into hospital and rest of the wings are left as museum for ppl to visit.

visiting charges is 30 for adult and for evening light show it costs 300 per person.

the main highlight of the cellular jail is the evening light show, so I recommend to not miss it.

important thing is that for light show one must book the tickets online and it needs to be done 1 day prior to get earlier slots.

so if you are planning to see light show, then book it prior to your visit to port blair else you might not get the ticket.

advice to management, washrooms are very dirty and stinking, please make sure you make something to keep it clean, because everyday thousands tourist across the world come here and dirty toilets or washrooms make wrong impression of the place.

But this is more of a first day in Andaman, knackered from flight but want to do something low effort for a few hours before an early night than a must see.

The light and sound show was both very impressive and cheap at the same time, hard to explain, the lights were so so so well done. The video projections on the other hand. Felt a bit like they got a group of guys together in a studio and bashed out the entire visuals in an afternoon. It was laughable at times. But still glad I saw it!

So this is an ideal low effort activity to do. Get some tasty IG shots out of it at the very least!

The place speaks volumes of the courage of our forefathers, the countless revolutionaries. The light and sound show in the evenings is moving (pun intended). You walk out with a heavy heart.

One cannot stop the car right in front of the Cellular Jail hence theres a two minute walk to reach there.

For the tour of Kaala Paani, I highly recommend taking part in the guided tour that the authorities at the Cellular Jail organize, one every thirty minutes. Will give a much better perspective.

Visit was pretty amazing.

If you are Indian then you must see once atleast.

They allow to click photos or video for the jail premises

Organization team think that we should respect the people who fought for our independence and lets everyone respect to their thinking and avoid clicking funny pictures.

More than 1000 people visit here every day.

Ticket price is around 300/- rupees

Usually it takes 1 to 2 hours to complete the visit

Note- First visit celular jail in day time to understand history and after that watch light show to grab and understand most of the things.

There is Veer Savarkar park, just like a waiting area for light show of celular jail.

While seating there you can also see multiple statue of people those who had fought and given their life for Indipendence of India.

The jail with its remaining wings showcase years of Indian history filled with torture, punishment, and tears. One would surely get goosebumps walking along the prison cells, entering them and realising the level of the punishment received. A guide is recommended for detailed explanation during exploration, one will be approached by a guide and has to pay a small fee to be guided throughout the cell. Above all, Id personally recommend you to NOT MISS the Light and Sound Show, its a truly beautiful demonstration filled with narration and visuals thatd ascertain tears in the eyes by the end of the show. Overall, a 10 out of 10 tourist spot, probably the most significant one in Port Blair.

There are clear instructions written everywhere and the display galleries near the entrance give a thorough overview of various events in the freedom struggle as well as of the construction of the jail itself.

We paid for the guide but aside from some minor facts and figures presented by him, the narrative was a huge put off. Most of his talk was about the importance of history and how we need to teach it to our children, who dont care about it anymore (in his mind). Too many of his opinions affected the quality of the information presented by him. Without undermining the cruelty inflicted by the British in Kaala Pani, it is important to move beyond emotion and opinion when presenting historical events or people. Only then will we truly understand their significance and ask meaningful questions.

Youll get goosebumps when youll be watching the world class Light and Sound show here, youll have tears in your eyes by seeing the brutality our freedom fighters have faced, the untold stories. There were 7 corridors of this jail which as of today stood at 3.5 only, .5 got demolished and 3 corridors are now converted to a hospital.

One can easily read the entire history of the jail from the information hall which is on the right of the entrance.

Once you have seen this hall, proceed to wing 7 and visit Veer Savarkars cell at the extreme corner.

All cells are identical. Its pointless to roam about in the other wings. However do visit the watch tower as the view of Mount Harriett, Ross Island and North Bay islands from here is spectacular.

The upgraded light and sound show that resumed on 23rd Jan, 2023 has to be booked online at Rs. 300 per head but its completely worth it. Its a must watch for this new generation to understand what went to realise the freedom that we take so lightly.

This program should be improved further. I hope you will like the suggestion.

That we do a lot for ourselves, can you show the courage to come out and lift the boat for the welfare of all?

Think about it and then sacrifice yourself.

A holy pilgrimage to be done with devotion and patriotism as much as Kashi Yatra.

If you have read Majhi Janmthep, everything here is about the tortures suffered by many patriots including Krantisurya Savarkar, the conditions at that time and
Actually that time is standing in front of us.

Total 698 cells..
What kind of dungeons are the dungeons? A cellular prison structure with a tower in the center and 7 buildings in 7 directions around it.
With the vast ocean on one side, the jail building is a model of ideal architecture, but an architectural structure that reflects the inhumane atrocities of the British.
The sea is right next to it but its sight is not visible and the structure of the cell is such that not even a common man, let alone a bird, can be seen in the prison premises.
With only sunlight coming through a small window.
Even though Savarkars brothers are in the same jail, they have not seen each other for years, let alone meet them.
And at the same time, the internal structure shows demoralizing things. Inhumane punishments such as death row, cages given to the captives and the deafening cries while undergoing them....
All essence will be crushed. The fear of that time will bring a thorn in the body.....

Only 3 buildings out of 7 survive over time. But the same is beautifully preserved. Each building has three floors. At the same time, the photos and objects that will be taken during that time are worth seeing in the museum without missing a beat.....

In fact, at that time no prisoner was kept permanently in one cell. A detainee in one building was not remotely related to a detainee in another building. Savarkars long stay in the black cell on the second floor, which was punished by his long stay and which inspires us today, was the sight of the open gallows from this cell, the screams and cries of the prisoners who were suffering from inhuman hellish torture.
To be khachchi, to eat in the same cell, to sleep in the same room, to do all the body dharma..
Bapre! Just thinking about it makes you cringe and that time stands before your eyes and the hellish torture that Savarkar suffered.
By seeing reality, by remembering
Emotions burst...
Unknowingly, the edges of the eyes widen.
We entered the room with heavy hearts and pounding hearts.
Death appearing in different forms from moment to moment..
In this state
Eternal Me .. Infinite Me ..
Awadhya I am good
Fire net Majsi
Nor the rock pierces
Im afraid
death runs away

Savarkar who says...
What kind of bone is this man...
Maybe only God can tell..

While he was living in the dungeon under the torture of hell, how could he have created Sahastra Ovas epic poem Kamala on the walls of the dungeon with his supernatural talent, without a pen and paper.

If the bricks, walls, stones and soil here started talking, then every event here would have been told with great pride and passion.
What to say to this talent and intelligence!

The hands were unknowingly joined while bowing before the picture placed in front.. the dam of emotions broke .. and then Savarkars own lines came to the rescue even while giving way to the emotions.

* took Majsi back to motherland..*
*The ocean yearned for life, the ocean yearned...*
