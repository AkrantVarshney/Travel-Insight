Visitors often enjoy a serene boat ride, taking in the picturesque landscapes and vibrant floating gardens.

However, during peak tourist seasons, the lake can get crowded, which might detract from the peaceful experience some seek.

The experience was both enchanting and eye-opening. there are a few things you should consider.

**Stay on a Houseboat:**
If you visit Dal Lake, staying at least one night on a houseboat is a must. The experience is unlike any other, offering a blend of traditional Kashmiri hospitality and breathtaking views. In the evening, don't miss out on a shikara ride. Not only is it peaceful, but it also allows you to explore the floating markets on the lake. Shopping from a shikara is a unique and memorable experience, though keep in mind that it can be a bit pricey.

**Tips for Houseboat Booking:**
When booking a houseboat, it's better to do so offline rather than online. This allows you to bargain, which can get you a much better deal--sometimes cheaper than a hotel stay. If possible, choose the last room on the houseboat; these rooms tend to be more spacious and offer better views.

**Environmental Concerns:**
However, it's important to note that the beauty of Dal Lake is marred by some environmental issues. Unfortunately, some houseboat owners contribute to the pollution by directly discharging waste into the lake. Additionally, littering by both locals and tourists has led to certain areas of the lake becoming quite dirty. This neglect by houseboat operators and visitors is a serious issue that affects the lakes ecosystem and overall appeal.

**Final Thoughts:**
Dal Lake remains a stunning and culturally rich destination, but being mindful of its environmental challenges is crucial. By making responsible choices and encouraging sustainable practices, visitors can help preserve this jewel of Kashmir for future generations.",a month ago,2024-09-24T00:03:47,,,null,0,85,644,1,null,null

Its renowned for its serene waters, picturesque landscapes, and traditional houseboats.

The best time to visit is during spring (March to May) when the weather is pleasant, and the gardens around the lake are in full bloom. Summer (June to August) is also ideal for comfortable temperatures, perfect for boat rides and sightseeing. Autumn (September to November) offers beautiful scenery with crisp air and changing leaves, though it can be chilly. Winter (December to February) provides a magical snowy landscape, but it can be quite cold, and some boat services might be limited.

During your visit, taking a Shikara ride is a must. Its a great way to experience the lakes beauty and see the floating gardens. Staying in one of Dal Lakes houseboats can offer a unique experience, with many equipped with modern amenities for a comfortable stay. Exploring the local markets around the lake is a great opportunity to shop for souvenirs like Kashmiri shawls, carpets, and handicrafts. Its also important to dress modestly and respect local customs.

When visiting, ensure you do not litter or pollute the lake, as maintaining cleanliness is crucial. In winter, be cautious of slippery paths and limited accessibility, and make sure youre prepared for cold weather. Avoid aggressive bargaining in local markets; fair trade supports local artisans and vendors. Also, be mindful of your personal belongings and avoid venturing out alone late at night.

Dal Lake offers a picturesque destination with a rich cultural backdrop, and by following these guidelines, you can ensure a pleasant and memorable visit.",a month ago,2024-09-24T00:03:48,,,null,0,221,1077,1,null,null

It was pretty good to rest under the rooftop of Shikara in the lazy noon. Also, the Shikara ride at dusk and night time was soothing.
You can spend your time beside the lake at evening time to get the beautiful sunset view. While having the ride, you can grab a BBQ, chai and more.
The Mullahs keep following you/ tourist for rides even if refused and some charges high without a doubt.
The lake was not clean as per the reason- dead fish were floating, water has turned greenish and more.

Hukkah Haven: One enjoyable aspect is the availability of hourly hookah rentals. Combining this with a leisurely shikara ride while taking in the picturesque scenery is a delightful way to relax.

Whether you're an early riser catching the stunning sunrise over the lake or indulging in a serene shikara ride, this place leaves you spellbound. The stillness of the water, reflecting the majestic Himalayas, creates a tranquil environment that's hard to find elsewhere.

The sunrise at Dal Lake is a spectacle you won't want to miss. As the first light of the day touches the surrounding mountains, the lake transforms into a canvas of golden hues. It's an incredibly peaceful time to be on the water, with the soft morning mist adding a mystical element to the experience.

A shikara ride on Dal Lake is an absolute must. It's a leisurely way to explore the lake's vast expanse, dotted with lotus flowers and charming houseboats. In the evening, the lake comes alive with floating markets where you can shop for local handicrafts, jewelry, and spices. However, shopping here is an art--be prepared to negotiate hard. Prices are often inflated, and haggling is expected, so shop only if you're comfortable with the bargaining process.

Staying on a houseboat is a unique experience that enhances your visit to Dal Lake. These houseboats are well-equipped with modern amenities, yet they retain a traditional charm that offers a glimpse into Kashmiri culture. Waking up to the views of the lake from your room is an experience like no other.

Dal Lake is a must-visit destination in Srinagar, offering a blend of natural beauty, cultural immersion, and adventure. From the peaceful sunrise to the lively evening markets, every moment here is enchanting.

Better to go evening after 7.30 or early morning.
Need to bargain and get the best price if not included in the package.
There are lot of entrance to the boats. Ghat1 to ghat 18 or more
We did in ghat 10. They say its less rush and clean. I felt all same.
The basic package is one hour ride. Have to pay additional to see floating market, meena bazar...from personal view its waste to pay additional.

If you want to experience need to pay additional 1200 to 1800 depending upon the stops like, floating market, meena bazar, long lake etc.

The lake wasn't that clean as it would have expected but it wasn't half bad either.

The shikara ride was comforting while enjoying beverages and snacks which comes to you rightfully to your seats by shikara vendors.

The best time to enjoy the Dal lake is during sunset or sunrise with limited people and less crowd to get the best shots as well ;)

Tips from my:

1. Do not purchase anything from that market specifically Kesar as it's mostly fake and other stuff is over priced. There is an entire lane and shops to shop from in Dal lake and if you find something exquisite go for it otherwise don't!

2. Haggle and bargain as much as you could prior booking Shikara as they quote thrice the price at least that they can take you on. And it's true to purchasing anything for that matter.

Around it, you can spot Mughal gardens like Nishat Bagh & houseboats. Don't miss the relaxing shikara ride, called 'the Gondola of Kashmir'.

You'll be astonished to see the multiple uses of shikaras - ferrying visitors, vending of fruits etc., fishing, & aquatic vegetation harvesting.

On your shikara ride, you can spot 'rad' - vegetation that's detached from the lake bottom but still anchored! We believe you can swim & canoe in the Dal Lake too (not sure though).

The scene before us was like a painting come to life: emerald-green waters framed by majestic snow-capped peaks, verdant gardens, and rustic houseboats adorned with vibrant floral motifs. Each stroke of natures brush seemed to create a masterpiece that captivated our senses and stirred our souls.

Cruising along the tranquil canals and waterways of Dal Lake, we were greeted by a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds. Colorful shikaras dotted the horizon, ferrying locals and tourists alike across the lake, while vendors in their floating shops peddled a tantalizing array of Kashmiri handicrafts, spices, and street food.

Stepping ashore, we explored the vibrant floating markets and bustling waterfront promenades that lined the shores of Dal Lake. The air was filled with the melodious strains of traditional Kashmiri music, the laughter of children playing by the waters edge, and the fragrant aroma of saffron-infused chai wafting from nearby tea stalls.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and gold, we were treated to a spectacle of unparalleled beauty. The tranquil waters of Dal Lake transformed into a mirror-like surface, reflecting the majestic beauty of the surrounding mountains and the twinkling lights of the houseboats that dotted its shores.

Spread over approximately 18 square kilometers, this iconic lake is renowned for its stunning scenery, serene waters, and floating gardens, earning it the moniker Jewel in the Crown of Kashmir.

The lake is fringed by majestic mountains, with the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas providing a dramatic backdrop. Shikaras, traditional wooden boats, glide gracefully across the shimmering waters, ferrying locals and tourists alike. The shores are dotted with vibrant houseboats, intricately decorated with colorful motifs and offering a unique and tranquil accommodation experience.

One of the most enchanting aspects of Dal Lake is its floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri. These gardens, built atop layers of floating vegetation and soil, are a marvel of human ingenuity and agricultural innovation. Here, farmers grow a variety of vegetables and flowers, creating a surreal landscape that seems to defy conventional farming methods.

Visitors to Dal Lake can indulge in a variety of activities, from leisurely Shikara rides to adventurous water sports such as kayaking and water skiing. The lake is also a paradise for birdwatchers, with numerous species of migratory birds making it their temporary home during the winter months.

However, Dal Lake is not without its challenges. Pollution and encroachment have threatened its delicate ecosystem, prompting conservation efforts to preserve this natural wonder for future generations to enjoy.

In essence, Dal Lake is not just a geographical feature; its a symbol of Kashmirs rich cultural heritage and natural splendor, captivating all who have the privilege of experiencing its timeless beauty.",6 months ago,2024-04-24T00:04:15,,,null,2,94,621,1,null,null

We changed the boarding point for the Shikara and went to the Nehru garden point, opted for the boat ride without siteseeing through the lake and we enjoyed it a lot with the breathtaking view of the valley and the take. The boatman Arif took us to the floating market and also stopped to get Kawah (Kashmiri tea) and chocolates for our son. He even took pictures of us and was singing kashmiri song, which made the experience more fun. The house boats look good but we didnt try them. This was our second trip to the lake and so guided tour didnt make sense. They show the Nehru garden, and a house boat where a scene of thethe Bollywood Mission Kashmir movie was shot and the floating market with photographers offering to take family pictures with Kashmiri costumes, sell local kesar (Saffron), pashmina shawls, imported chocolates and ready food like, tea, pakoras, tandoori tikkas on the shikara.

Spanning approximately 18 square kilometers, Dal Lake is renowned for its stunning vistas, serene waters, and unique floating gardens known as raadh.

Visitors to Dal Lake can experience its tranquil beauty by taking a shikara ride, a traditional wooden boat adorned with colorful decorations. These leisurely rides offer breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains, lush gardens, and intricately carved houseboats that line the lakes shores.

One of the most iconic features of Dal Lake is its floating market, where local vendors sell a variety of goods, including fresh produce, handicrafts, and traditional Kashmiri attire. Exploring this bustling market provides insight into the vibrant culture and economy of the region.

For those seeking a more immersive experience, staying in a houseboat on Dal Lake is a must. These floating accommodations offer a unique opportunity to live amidst the tranquil waters, with luxurious amenities and personalized service adding to the charm of the experience.

Additionally, Dal Lake is home to the famous Mughal Gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh, Nishat Bagh, and Chashme Shahi, which showcase stunning terraced lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and intricately designed water features.

There was bare minimum snowfall across Kashmir. The Dal is one of the classic tourist traps that are hard to avoid. It's a beautiful lake and some of the efforts to protect it are commendable but feels like a losing battle against the massive influx of domestic tourists. The lake is just packed with Shikharas and houseboats. You can't get on to a shikhara without navigating dozens of pushy salespeople. In the shikhara prepare to have more salesmen get uncomfortably close in their shikharas to sell you everything from trinkets to Maggi. The part of the lake where there is most of the tourist activity is just like any odd Indian road covered in plastic and other trash. The farther you travel from this area the better. The standard ride then takes you through a market on the water where again you encounter more sales activity. You circle back into the busier area. Overall, it is the Dal lake so you do have to go there but it's neither peaceful nor awe inspiring. Everything authentic about the experience has been replaced by the familiar and minor comfort. The most disappointing aspect is the aggressive salespersons. Given how dependent the economy is on tourism it is difficult to complain beyond a point, but my recommendation to the locals is to be a bit more respectful of personal space and don't get so close that it gets uncomfortable. To tourists my request is try to pick up after yourself if you must eat Maggi and chips on the lake. Finally, like most things in Kashmir the pricing is opaque so be prepared to chat a storm with the locals on everything. Will post another review on the houseboat.",8 months ago,2024-02-24T00:04:24,,,null,0,53,null,1,null,null

The lake, encompassing approximately 15.5 square kilometers, is renowned for its stunning landscape, encompassing floating gardens and the iconic houseboats.

**Scenic Beauty:**
Dal Lake is celebrated for its picturesque surroundings. Visitors often marvel at the pristine waters reflecting the snow-capped Himalayas, creating a breathtaking panorama. The Mughal gardens, including Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh, enhance the allure with their vibrant flowers and well-maintained lawns.

**Houseboats:**
Houseboats are an integral part of the Dal Lake experience. These floating accommodations offer a unique stay, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the local culture. The intricately decorated houseboats provide comfort while showcasing the traditional Kashmiri architecture.

**Shikara Rides:**
Shikara rides are a must-do activity on Dal Lake. These wooden boats adorned with colorful canopies take visitors on a leisurely journey across the lake, providing an up-close view of the floating market, where local vendors sell an array of items, from handicrafts to fruits.

I visited in July 2023 and could go for a shikara ride around sunset time. Ride itself was soothing with spectacular sunset views and we could even manage a very closer view of the water fountain show which was going on.

I personally have considered Dal Lake  to be a hyped-up lake with an opportunity for a good ride around but honestly, its much more than just a large lake with shikara rides. There is much commercial activity going along like houseboat stays, water plant harvesting, fishing, floating markets and more. During extreme winter months, entire lake will be frozen but then its the time for winter sports and related activities. Its just like a lifeline for many people.

Its really a large lake complete with 3 tiny islands and some landmarks, and the most commendable part is its Idyllic setting. Its covered in most sides by majestic mountains, and I can only imagine the spectacular views it has to offer during winter months when there is snow around.

So instead of the regular Must Visit Tag , I will recommend it with a MUST MULTIPLE VISIT LOCATION  so that you can enjoy its beauty completely.",9 months ago,2024-01-24T00:04:30,,,null,4,158,663,1,null,null

We spent 800 rs for a one-hour shikara ride, with 5 points, but it felt like these points were made up. If you dont have shopping plans, I recommend the half-hour ride for 400 rs.

Stepping onto the tranquil waters of Dal Lake feels like entering a dreamlike world. The shimmering lake is surrounded by magnificent mountains, lush greenery, and charming houseboats that add to its ethereal beauty.

As you glide along the calm waters, you are greeted by the soothing melody of paddles dipping into the lake, the rhythmic chants of the boatmen, and the gentle breeze caressing your face. The experience is nothing short of magical.

One of the highlights of the Dal Lake experience is the opportunity to stay in a luxurious houseboat. These intricately designed floating accommodations provide an exquisite blend of comfort and tradition. Inside, youll find elegantly furnished rooms, adorned with intricate Kashmiri craftsmanship. From the window, you can witness the vibrant floating markets, where locals sell colorful handicrafts, fresh produce, and delicious Kashmiri cuisine.

Exploring the lake in a shikara, a traditional wooden boat, is another memorable experience. As your shikara glides through the water, youre treated to breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks, the Mughal gardens lining the lakes shores, and the floating gardens adorned with vibrant flowers.

In the evening, the lake transforms into a stunning spectacle, as the sun sets behind the mountains, casting an ethereal light on the water. The reflection of the vibrant houseboats and majestic mountains creates a surreal ambiance that leaves a lasting impression.

Visiting Dal Lake is not just a sightseeing experience; its an immersion into the rich culture and serene beauty of Kashmir. The serene waters, the friendly locals, the majestic landscapes, and the vibrant markets combine to create an unforgettable experience that will linger in your memory long after you depart.",11 months ago,2023-11-24T00:04:44,,,null,3,6,15,1,null,null

Dal Lake: It is absolutely the most stunning scenery. It is gorgeous. Surrounded by the snow-capped mountains on three sides, Houseboats and shikaras are a constant part of the lake scenery. And the reflection of the Zabarwan ranges on the clear waters of Dal Lake is mesmerizing to say the least.

Houseboat: It is app youd expect and more. Just stay for a day and youll fall in love with it. Not giving any spoilers. Have a great trip ",11 months ago,2023-11-24T00:04:48,,,null,0,2,null,,null,null

Upon arriving at Dal Lake, youll be welcomed by a Shikara, a traditional wooden boat, which will transport you to your houseboat. The moment you step aboard, youll be greeted by the friendly staff. Houseboats on Dal Lake are floating works of art. They are often beautifully decorated with intricate wooden carvings, Persian carpets, and traditional Kashmiri handicrafts. The houseboats come in various sizes and offer a range of amenities, from cozy to luxurious. The feeling of being gently rocked to sleep by the water is both soothing and memorable. The houseboats are moored on the serene waters of Dal Lake, surrounded by pristine nature. The lake is ringed by lush gardens, snow-capped mountains, and quaint villages. Waking up to the sight of the shimmering lake and the majestic Himalayas in the background is a breathtaking experience. One of the most cherished experiences is taking a sunset Shikara ride on Dal Lake. As the sun sets behind the mountains, the lake transforms into a golden wonderland. Your Shikara can be adorned with colorful flowers and will take you on a leisurely ride, allowing you to witness the changing hues of the sky and water. A ride in the evening or night was an enchanting memory. Dal Lake is often dotted with floating markets, where local artisans and vendors offer their wares. On our way during the Shikara ride had a cup of aromatic Kashmiri Kahwa, a traditional saffron-infused tea. This warm welcome sets the tone for your entire stay. You can shop for traditional handicrafts, jewelry, and even fresh produce right from your houseboat. Its a unique shopping experience you wont find anywhere else. The serene and peaceful environment of a houseboat provides a welcome escape from the noise and chaos of city life. Its an ideal place for relaxation, or simply unwinding while listening to the gentle lapping of water. A stay on a houseboat in Dal Lake is not just an accommodation choice; its an immersive experience that offers an intimate connection with the natural beauty, culture, and warm hospitality of Kashmir. Its an opportunity to create lasting memories while living on the water in a serene and captivating environment.",11 months ago,2023-11-24T00:04:49,,,null,0,105,248,1,null,null

A serene, vast lake with an entire mini civilization living in the water, Dal Lake is a must visit.

There are shikara rides available. There are 45 shikara stands, where shikara riders park their ornamentally adorned shikaras.

The shikara ride is another attraction to experience the living habitat within the Dal lake. They have multiple options that you can choose from, hour wise or 4 attractions or 6 attractions or full lake tour. The prices for each differ

We went in the morning at 11 am and took the full lake tour. It starts from one end of the widespread lake and takes you through the village settled in the lake, local artifacts shops where you can shop. There are carpet making handloooms that show you how the silk is yarned and soft fabric manufactured. They give you details of all the types of embroidery and significance of it. You will also be able to see the manufacturing of the ships and shikaras. Its amazing to see how all of this industry is standing and prevailing in the lake over water.

The best time is to go either in the morning or towards late afternoon to prevent yourself from the sun and extreme chill in the evening. However, there are many who enjoy the sunsets and the moon views as well.

You will come across a lot of local with their private small boats crossing you to go shopping from their groceries or dropping kids to the school.

There are photographers who rent the kashmiri dresses and take your photos in the Dal Lake. For a minimum cost they give you prints of it as a memoir

The only nuisance is the sellers who bother you through the ride. There are tea sellers, woodwork artifact vendors, florists, jewelery sellers, and a dozen others who keep persisting you to buy.

Thankfully, we had a good boat rider who didnt coax us to buy anything from anywhere and let us enjoy the magnificent lake

Overall, you cant miss the Dal Lake or the shikara ride if you are in kashmir",11 months ago,2023-11-24T00:04:54,,,null,0,57,100,1,null,null

Shikara ride was amazing there were plenty of options to explore Dal lake From 1hour to 4 hour shikara ride. You can explore complete Kashmir in Shikara in 4 hour ride including their floating Market and other attractions in Kashmir. They charge around Rs. 800 per hour for 1 Shikara which can accommodate 3-4 people.

We paid approx Rs.400 for half hour Shikara Ride for total 3 people in 1 Shikara . Usually Shikara driver will ask for tips after completing shikara ride and you can pay tips according to your budget. We paid Rs. 100 as tips

Do not miss to stay in amazing houseboats located in Dal lake. Most houseboats offer 1 free pickup and Drop in shikara to their houseboats located in Dal lake. Most of them also offers complimentary Shikara ride for 1 hour.

The lake was formed by the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, and it covers an area of 18 square kilometers. The scenic view of the lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks is awe-inspiring.

The shikara rides are a must-try, providing a peaceful and relaxing way to explore the lake's beauty. You can see the sparkling water, the colorful flowers, the floating gardens, and the wooden architecture of the houseboats. The houseboats add to the charm, offering a distinctive stay option. They are decorated with intricate carvings and carpets, and they have all the modern amenities.

However, it is advisable to be careful while dealing with vendors, as they can be insistent. Note that the water of Dal lake is not potable. Also remember to bargain well with shikhara wallahs, as the price can be reduced significantly.

Overall, Dal Lake is a must-visit for its natural beauty and tranquil atmosphere. I enjoyed my visit to Dal Lake very much, and I was amazed by its diversity and dynamism.

One important thing is chaar Minar. Below are the important points, if someone really wants to enjoy dal lake beauty.
1. Never go with package to cover the 6 or 4 points. Its a ride of only 1 hour and you will only see the points, my personal experience - No use. Always prefer to hire the shikara for 3 to 4 hours. Hourly rate 400 rs to 600 rs (depending on negotiation skills) and fix the deal to take you at char Minar. Otherwise they will show you only from distance.
2. Always take evening ride.
3. No worry for food and snacks, other shikara with full amenities will come to your shikara. Also several outlets are present in Dal lake. Additionally, one can bring their own item also on shikara.
4. Any souvenir items, prefer to take from road side market which gets active in the evening at outside lake.
5. For photography, prefer to take soft copy (40 to 50 rs per copy) as it is much cheaper than hardcopy.
6. Public toilet is available at char Minar and near to ghat no 16 but it depends on luck whether it is clean or not. So, its better to do all these at your hotel stay itself.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:05:01,,,null,0,55,95,1,null,null

We finally agreed to pay 800/hr for the boat ride (gang of 4 adults and a kid). During the ride, we can buy some eatables from the vendors on the boat.

It was our first visit and we also planned to go on a Shikara boat ride in the evening. I had a different opinion about this lake, but after the visit it changed my mind. It was not so clean and the corporation needed to concentrate to maintain this lake very clean. I would like to streamline the boat cost as well and I hate to bargain. We finally agreed to pay 800/hr for the boat ride (gang of 4 adults and a kid). During the ride, we can buy some eatables from the vendors on the boat. Inside the lake, there is a floating market also available. If you have time, and want to purchase something from such shops - you can shop as well. The boat operator wont charge you more for this shopping - so no need to pay extra for the shopping hours ( thats the deal we got from the boat person)

1. There is a small park available at the middle of the lake
2. Boat house is available
3. Different entrances are available, because its a very big lake. We entered the worst area, so decide and choose the best entrance to start your journey.

Rating:  (5/5)

I recently had the privilege of visiting Dal Lake in Kashmir, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. This place truly lives up to its reputation as a paradise on earth.

The first thing that struck me was the breathtaking natural beauty. Surrounded by majestic snow-capped mountains, the lakes tranquil waters mirror the stunning scenery, creating a mesmerizing reflection that seems almost surreal. The Shikara rides were an absolute highlight. Gliding through the calm waters, I was treated to a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors, with the floating gardens and picturesque houseboats adding to the charm.

The hospitality of the locals is unmatched. The warm smiles and genuine friendliness of the people made me feel right at home. They were more than happy to share their rich culture and history, which added a deeper layer of meaning to my visit.

Staying in a houseboat was a unique experience that Ill cherish forever. The intricate woodwork and luxurious amenities provided a comfortable and memorable stay. Waking up to the gentle rocking of the boat and the sound of water lapping against the sides was incredibly soothing.

The local cuisine was a delight for my taste buds. The traditional Wazwan feast was a culinary journey through the flavors of Kashmir, and the saffron-infused Kahwa tea was the perfect way to end a meal.

Exploring the Mughal Gardens, especially the Nishat Bagh and Shalimar Bagh, was like stepping into a dream. The meticulously manicured lawns, cascading fountains, and fragrant blooms created a sensory experience that left me awe-inspired.

I must also commend the efforts taken for conservation and cleanliness. The lake was remarkably well-maintained, and initiatives for preserving its ecological balance were evident throughout my visit.

In short, Dal Lake is a destination that deserves a spot on everyones travel bucket list. Its beauty, culture, and warm hospitality make it an experience that will stay with you long after you leave. I cannot wait to return to this slice of heaven on earth.

Note: This review reflects my personal experience and may vary for others, but I wholeheartedly recommend Dal Lake to anyone seeking a magical and enriching travel experience.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:05:15,,,null,0,32,34,1,null,null

Spread over an area of approximately 18 square kilometers, it is known for its breathtaking beauty and tranquil atmosphere. The lake is surrounded by picturesque mountains, green meadows, and beautiful gardens, making it a visual delight for visitors.

The unique feature of Dal Lake is its interconnected network of canals and channels, which are navigable by traditional wooden boats called Shikaras. These boats are widely used for transportation and sightseeing purposes. Floating markets and shops selling handicrafts, fruits, and flowers can be found on these Shikaras, adding to the charm of the place.

Dal Lake is also home to houseboats, which are stationary floating hotels providing a unique accommodation experience to visitors. These houseboats are beautifully crafted and offer stunning views of the lake and its surroundings. Staying in a houseboat is a popular choice for tourists seeking a serene and refreshing getaway.

The lake is also famous for its beautiful Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh, which were built by the Mughal emperors as a retreat for relaxation and enjoyment. These gardens are adorned with beautifully manicured lawns, fountains, colorful flowers, and intricate architectural designs.

Overall, Dal Lake is a paradise for nature lovers, photographers, and those seeking solace amidst natures beauty. It continues to attract thousands of tourists from around the world, offering them a peaceful and rejuvenating experience in the lap of nature.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:05:20,,,null,0,1,null,,null,null

The melodious calls of the birds, the scent of the pine trees, and the cool breeze off the water created an atmosphere of serenity thats hard to find elsewhere. As the sun painted the sky with hues of orange during sunset, I couldnt help but feel a profound sense of gratitude for witnessing such natural wonders.

This iconic destination deserves every bit of its reputation as the Jewel in the Crown of Kashmir. As I embarked on a mesmerizing shikara ride across its tranquil waters, I couldnt help but be captivated by its sheer beauty and serenity.

The first thing that struck me was the awe-inspiring scenery surrounding the lake. The majestic snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas provided an unforgettable backdrop, creating a picturesque vista that felt straight out of a postcard. The vibrant floating gardens adorned with blooming flowers added a touch of whimsy, while the charming wooden houseboats showcased the unique cultural heritage of the region.

Exploring the lake, I discovered the floating markets, where local vendors sold an array of handicrafts, spices, and authentic Kashmiri cuisine. It was a delight to interact with the warm and friendly locals, who shared stories about their traditions and way of life. The soothing sound of traditional Kashmiri music playing in the distance created a truly immersive experience.

Dal Lake is not just a feast for the eyes; it also offers a range of activities to indulge in. I had the opportunity to try water skiing and kayaking, which added an exciting touch to my visit. For those seeking tranquility, a relaxing shikara ride during sunset is an absolute must. As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, I felt a profound sense of peace and contentment.

The infrastructure around the lake was commendable, with well-maintained walkways and gardens that enhanced the overall experience. The hospitality of the locals was exceptional, making me feel welcomed and ensuring I had a memorable stay.

Dal Lake truly deserves its reputation as a paradise on Earth. Whether youre a nature enthusiast, a culture lover, or simply seeking a peaceful retreat, this enchanting destination has it all. Its a place where time stands still, allowing you to immerse yourself in the beauty and tranquility of nature.

I did shikha ride on my first day, I reached hotel in the morning stayed for a while, and took a taxi, first I visited few gardens and then I came in the afternoon to the dal lake. Before taking the ride I had lunch at nearby restaurant. Took few pictures before the ride.
View while shikhara riding, it was just another experience one will remember for the rest of the life.
They asked for high prices but you need to bargain to get the fair price.
While riding you can enjoy a cappuccino in the middle of the lake, One will get the perfect view for taking pictures. The floating market is just amazing, Different unique jewellery they have which you can try, you will get everything on fair prices but for this you have to bargain.
The evening view besides the lake is amazing the new fountain area looks cool. It is one My great experience. afternoon.
I heard alot about shikhara ride shikhara ride, I was so excited for the ride, whoever my friends visited kashmir they all suggested me that you have to go for the Shikara ride.
I didnt thought that Shikara ride will be this much fun and relaxing, the lakes water was so cold

This enchanting lake offers a range of activities such as shikara rides, speed boating, and even jet skiing, providing an exhilarating experience for visitors of all ages.

The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the serene shikara ride. Gliding through the calm waters of Dal Lake, surrounded by breathtaking vistas of mountains, lush greenery, and the stunning reflections of the floating gardens and houseboats, was a truly memorable experience. The view is nothing short of mesmerizing, and its a feast for the eyes and the soul.

Beyond its tourism appeal, Dal Lake holds great geographic importance for the region. It is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Kashmir, spanning an impressive area. Nestled amidst the picturesque Himalayan mountains, the lake not only enhances the natural beauty of Srinagar but also serves as a vital resource for the local communities.

Dal Lake is not just a body of water; it is an ecosystem in itself. The floating gardens, known as Rad, provide a unique agricultural system where vegetables and flowers are cultivated. These floating gardens are an incredible sight and showcase the ingenuity and adaptability of the local people.

The lake is also home to numerous houseboats, which serve as floating accommodations for tourists. These intricately designed houseboats offer a unique and unforgettable experience, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the peaceful surroundings and experience the rich culture and hospitality of Kashmir.

Visiting Dal Lake is a must-do when in Srinagar. Whether you choose to leisurely explore the lake on a shikara, engage in exciting water sports, or simply take in the breathtaking views, its an experience that will leave you captivated and rejuvenated.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:05:50,,,null,0,39,105,1,null,null

So i have paid 1600 for two people for 8 point sight seeing and they were not willing to negotiate further , if you are a couple they will try to charge you more

Lies Dal Lake, a wonderland unseen.
Amidst towering mountains, a tranquil shore,
I ventured forth, to explore and adore.

A tapestry of colors, a painters delight,
Reflecting skies and mountains in gentle light.
The waters, like silk, shimmering and clear,
Whispering tales that the heart holds dear.

A symphony of ripples, a melody pure,
As shikaras glide, their oars secure.
I boarded one, floating with grace,
Adrift on Dal Lake, in a blissful embrace.

Lotus blooms, dancing in vibrant grace,
A riot of hues, an exquisite chase.
Their petals unfold, like natures art,
A mosaic of beauty, etched in my heart.

Floating gardens, a verdant surprise,
Where saffron blossoms reach for the skies.
The fragrance of blossoms, enchanting and rare,
Filling the air with loves tender flair.

The sun dips low, casting a golden haze,
Painting the horizon in a fiery blaze.
The mountains stand tall, as sentinels wise,
Witnessing the magic that time cant disguise.

In Dal Lakes embrace, I found solace deep,
A sanctuary where troubles would sleep.
Kashmirs beauty, a gift from above,
A testament to natures boundless love.

Oh, Dal Lake, your enchantment remains,
Forever etched in my memorys domains.
A cherished visit, a treasured embrace,
In the heart of Kashmir, a heavenly space.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:05:59,,,null,5,40,747,1,null,null

If you plan on exploring this breathtaking region, I highly recommend immersing yourself in the serene beauty of Dal Lake and indulging in the unforgettable experience of staying in a super deluxe houseboat.

Dal Lake is a mesmerizing gem that sparkles in the heart of Kashmir. As I embarked on my houseboat adventure, I was greeted by a surreal panorama of shimmering waters and majestic mountains, creating a picturesque backdrop that seemed straight out of a dream.

Staying in a houseboat on Dal Lake is an unparalleled delight. The luxurious super deluxe amenities provided surpassed all expectations, making me feel like royalty amidst the tranquil waters. The serene ambiance and the gentle sway of the houseboat lulled me into a state of pure relaxation and bliss.

One of the most memorable aspects of the experience was the floating shopping boats and the vibrant market that surrounds Dal Lake. It was an absolute delight to explore these floating wonders, browsing through a wide array of handicrafts, traditional artifacts, and local treasures. The cultural richness and artistic craftsmanship on display were awe-inspiring.

To enhance your Dal Lake experience, I urge you to indulge in a Shikara ride during the enchanting evening hours. Drifting through the calm waters, youll witness the golden hues of the setting sun reflecting upon the lakes surface, creating a magical ambiance that will leave you in awe. The tranquility of the surroundings and the gentle ripples of the water will transport you to a state of serenity and pure joy.

In conclusion, if youre planning a visit to Kashmir, I wholeheartedly recommend immersing yourself in the wonder of Dal Lake and the magical experience of staying in a super deluxe houseboat. Let the beauty of the lake and its surrounding floating market captivate your senses, while a serene Shikara ride adds the perfect touch of enchantment to your journey.

Embrace the allure of Kashmir and create cherished memories that will stay with you forever.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:06:01,,,null,7,128,45,1,null,null

Surrounded by majestic mountains and lush greenery, the lake is often referred to as the jewel of Kashmir. I had the opportunity to visit Dal Lake recently, and it left an indelible mark on my memory.

One of the highlights of my Dal Lake experience was staying in a traditional houseboat called a shikara. These beautifully crafted boats are adorned with intricate woodwork and offer a comfortable and authentic way to immerse oneself in the lakes tranquility. As I glided across the pristine waters, I was captivated by the stunning reflections of the surrounding snow-capped peaks and vibrant gardens.

The floating markets on the lake were a sight to behold. Local vendors paddled their shikaras filled with a variety of goods, including fresh flowers, fruits, and handicrafts. I couldnt resist the temptation to buy some exquisite Kashmiri souvenirs as a reminder of this enchanting experience.

Exploring the lake by a shikara also allowed me to witness the unique way of life of the local people. I observed fishermen casting their nets and locals going about their daily routines along the waterways. The vibrant houseboats, with their colorful facades and intricately designed interiors, added to the charm of the surroundings.

A visit to the Mughal Gardens, such as the Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh, which line the shores of Dal Lake, is a must. These meticulously manicured gardens, with their cascading fountains, blooming flowers, and terraced landscapes, offer a serene retreat and provide breathtaking views of the lake.

Another memorable aspect of my Dal Lake experience was witnessing the sunset over the mountains. The golden hues reflecting on the water and the tranquil ambiance created a truly magical moment. It was a time of reflection and appreciation for the natural beauty that surrounded me.

In conclusion, my experience at Dal Lake was nothing short of extraordinary. From the serene boat rides and vibrant floating markets to the stunning gardens and breathtaking sunsets, every moment spent at the lake was a feast for the senses. The beauty and tranquility of Dal Lake make it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable experience in Kashmir.",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:06:08,,,null,0,7,null,,null,null

Dal lake has a great view. Spread over a vast area provides great spot for tourists but we did not have a good experience.
We took a shikara and weather started to deteriorate, and our shikara started to sink. There was no life jacket. Luckily our shikara driver managed to pull it towards a rescue boat. We had an infant with us as well. Somehow we were saved by CRPF resume boats. I wont recommend it on a rainy or bad weather day.

The Shikara ride at Dal lake has to be one of the most peaceful and calm experience I've ever done. There's not a sound except that of the water being paddled. If there is such a thing as inner peace, it could be found here.

Pick up is from one of the 28 odd gates to the lake. The Shikara first takes you to Nehru park. En-route you can have kahwa, and shop for some snacks or wooden items from the passing Shikaras.

At Nehru park you can click photos with traditional Kashmiri outfits, but decide on the prices and number/ delivery of photos beforehand. A speedboat ride is also available.

From there the Shikara goes through Meena bazaar the famous floating market of dal lake. You can buy handicrafts/ clothes here.

After that the ride ends back at the gates. Truly a great experience. Worthwhile spending more time or taking another ride also.

Tip- the shikara person will take you to a particular shop only, you can ask to be shown another shop if you find one pricey.
The prices of clothes/ shawls/ wooden items may be LESS in the Srinagar market compared to Dal lake (if you have time to explore it).",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:06:19,,,null,0,74,322,1,null,null

You need to go for Kashmir Great Lakes Trek.
One of the most beautiful treks in India.
It validates Kashmirs mythical status as heaven on earth.
The Trail is super crowded with the lush green meadows, vista of colorful wild flowers and the pristine lakes made it up for it with a few boulder crossings.
The trek to the Kashmir Great Lakes Trek offers a lifetime experience of vintage memories that are so wonderfully tiring.

The boating was definitely a highlight, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains and lush greenery. It was a relaxing and peaceful way to take in the beauty of the lake.

But what really made the experience special was the opportunity to have snacks on the boat itself. It was a unique and memorable experience, and added to the charm and relaxation of the boat ride.

In addition, the tour guide took us on a tour of the vegetable plantations on the lake, which was a fascinating and educational experience. It was incredible to see how the locals have adapted to living on the lake and how they have created a self-sustaining ecosystem.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Dal Lake for anyone traveling to Srinagar. The boat ride is a must-do, and the added experience of having snacks on the boat and seeing the vegetable plantations makes it even more special",a year ago,2023-10-24T00:06:21,,,null,3,265,4631,1,null,null

One of the highlights of my visit was taking a shikara ride, which is a traditional wooden boat that is unique to the region. It was a wonderful way to see the lake and take in the scenery.

The lake is also home to several floating gardens, which are an incredible sight to see. These gardens are made up of hundreds of individual floating pieces of land, which are anchored to the bottom of the lake. Theyre filled with vibrant flowers and provide a unique and beautiful addition to the already stunning scenery.

It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. The lake is surrounded by mountains and is known for its scenic beauty. It is also famous for its houseboats and shikaras (small boats) which are used for transportation and sightseeing.

Dal lake has its own history and importance as Srinagar is mainly located around it. Well for experience of Shikara it is worth a go or if you want to stay in one of the house boats. Dal Lake is almost the center of Srinagar. It is a large and beautiful lake. One can either stay at houseboats which are built in the lake (which I would not recommend), or take a shikara ride (boat ride). It is better to take a shikara ride for more than an hour, as one can also enjoy the floating shops and market in the lake.

Dal Lake has a rich history that dates back to the Mughal era when the emperor Jahangir visited the valley in the 17th century and was captivated by its natural beauty. He ordered the construction of several gardens and pavilions around the lake, which transformed the area into a paradise for nature lovers and royalty alike.

According to another source, there are basically two theories that suggest how the lake originated.

Dal Lake is also an important source of livelihood for many locals, who rely on it for fishing and tourism. Visitors to the lake can take a shikara ride to explore its beautiful surroundings and also visit the floating gardens and markets that are set up on the lake.

Despite its popularity, the lake has faced various environmental challenges over the years, including pollution and encroachment. However, efforts are being made to preserve its beauty and protect its ecosystem.

The Dal Lake is known for its stunning beauty, with its crystal-clear waters surrounded by lush greenery and snow-capped mountains. The lake also has a number of floating gardens known as 'rad', where locals grow vegetables and fruits.

The best way to explore the Dal Lake is by taking a Shikara boat ride. These small boats take you around the lake, giving you stunning views of the surrounding landscape and the city of Srinagar.

It is an urban lake, the second largest lake in Jammu and Kashmir, and the most visited place in Srinagar by tourists and locals.Dal Lake is lined by gardens built in the Mughal era and many parks.
Mughals, who were smitten by the beauty of Kashmir, laid extensive gardens to heighten its beauty. The best views of the lake can be seen from the Shalimar Garden and Nishat Garden that were built during the reign of Mughal Emperor, Jehangir.

Shikaras are a cultural symbol of the lake and seen mostly in lakes of Srinagar. It is often called the Gondola of Kashmir and has achieved iconic status. While the boats are a part of daily life on the lake and used for a slew of purposes including transporting people and goods, it has become very popular with tourists. A ride on the lake is a must for tourists visiting Kashmir.

This Himalayan lake has 5 basins and several channels, which are well linked with each other. The blooming Mughal gardens and Orchards on the banks contribute a lot to the beauty of the Dal Lake. These colourful gardens and lawns were established in 16th and 17th century, but the tourism department has still maintained the natural beauty of these lawns.

The flora of the lake includes lotus, lillies and water chestnuts. While on a boat ride in Dal Lake, one may also notice birds like kingfishers and herons.

This hillside lake is home to the wonderfully carved wooden houseboats and colorful Shikaras (the small wooden carved boats) casually commuting through the scenic peaks of the Pir Panjal Mountains. It is spread across 22 square kilometers and its beauty kept growing as my Shikarawala rowed my Shikara deeper and deeper into its placid water flow!

Shikaras are extensively used to commute back and forth from the houseboats, for daily traveling, or for boating tours. They are very well maintained, beautifully decorated, and rowed by professionals who are well aware of the different aspects of Dal Lake, which makes the Shikara Rides even more exciting and interesting. Staying rooted in their old charm, the swift movement of a Shikara provided me with a unique way to experience the eternal beauty of Kashmir, and must say, they certainly add to the beauty of Dal Lake with their colorful presence!

The duration of the Shikara Ride at Dal Lake in Kashmir ranges from 1 hour to 4 hours, the Shikarawalas at one of the ghats surrounding the lake guided me regarding the same which helped me in choosing the ride as per my convenience. However, the pricing here is dynamic so the better your bargaining skills, the better chances of you bagging a worthy deal!

It was an experience of a lifetime for me as I got wooed by scenic vistas of the Zabarwan Range and the deepness of the calming Dal Lake. The vibrations in the water formed by the rowing of Shikarawala were an equally visual treat. The mesmerizing scene of surrounding snowy mountains looked even more beautiful at the sunset which reflected in the gleaming water of the lake.

The Shikara ride is incomplete without stopping at Meena Bazaar, a lively lake market. This market has a number of shops selling all sorts of goods including Kashmir's specialties such as wooden artifacts, handmade earrings, carpets, Kashmiri handicrafts, saffron, and even Kashmiri Pashmina shawls right in the middle of the lake. However, it is advisable to avoid shopping here as the rates are on the higher side and the authenticity of goods sold is doubtful.

Dal Lake is nothing short of heaven for film shootings and photography enthusiasts. May it be its floating gardens or the lush green spread around and the rocky terrains, it has various sights to offer for you to get those perfect shots! Besides this, I also got to see various birds while enjoying my ride which was indeed a cheerful sight.

A Shikara ride is the best way to enjoy a picturesque ride across the lake, especially because these wooden boats with pointed ends on both sides and with beautiful canopies overhead are a cultural symbol and can only be seen in Srinagar.

Must say, this ride helped me build memories of a lifetime, and was worth every penny. Spending a day in the calm waters of Dal Lake was one of the most relaxing aspects of my Kashmir Trip. It was hard to bid farewell to this delightful ride which made me fall in love with every nook and corner of the iconic Dal Lake against the backdrop of the snow-covered mountains but I'm definitely carrying a smile on my face, calmness of mind, the coolness of emotions and a heart filled with gratitude with me!",2 years ago,2022-10-24T00:07:19,,,null,27,57,183,1,null,null

Also, there is a market in the vicinity of the lake where you can buy local items that are famous in Srinagar like Kesar, Shawls, artefacts made of wood etc.
However, there is one thing which I did not like about the lake. The lake is not clean and it seems like you are boating in water full of moss, plastic & food waste floating around, some parts of the lake smells like sewer. I did not even put my hand in the water during the course if 1hr shikara ride.

However, there are some water cleaning boats that are cleaning the floating moss and plastic waste but the lake is so big that it will not make big difference.

Staying over houseboat is okay-okay experience. Its all depends on your experience. You do feel quite hot inside if you travelling in June last and july since water smell little bit and humidity is so much..

In the month of January lake turns into ice .
Prices or fair of boating is too high its approximately 4000 per boat for 2 hours.
There is a union for boats.
You can enjoy the trip.
Boating rider person let us know about places and shops.
Boating person allow us to stay at shop for buying goods.
Boating is called sikara at kashmeer.

DAL lake is covered with snow-capped mountains surrounding three of its sides, signature Kashmiri style houseboats and colorful shikaras that afloat the lake and the stunning Mughal gardens and orchards lined on its banks. Overlooking the lake are two hillocks that house the Shankaracharya and Hari Parbat temples. Yes, that is just how picturesque the Dal lake is. And the Dal lake images are a testimony to this fact.
Moreover, the floating gardens on the Dal have a magic of their own. They are an ecological system in the lake. Farmers residing here are dedicated to growing crops and vegetables on this lake. Over 6,000 families depend on these floating gardens for their livelihood. The produce obtained is then sold in local markets throughout Srinagar.
Its beauty hasn't just attracted tourists all over the world but quite a lot of filmmakers as well. As many as 20 films have been shot in and around this area. Some of the most popular ones include Kashmir ki Kali, Lamhaa, Kabhi Kabhi and Dil se- among many others.

We spent 2 nights at Dal Lake instead of staying in Srinagar. It was the best day of our 8-day trip. We did a wonderful Shikara cruise through the lake. While cruising, we experienced the scenic beauty, the reflection of mountains in the water, and a wonderful sunset where the sky changes colour. There are a lot of floating shops where you will find different antique collections. There are small boats that sell tasty barbecued chicken, fish, and paneer, etc. Close to the road that leads to Dal Lake dock, you can find a lot of street vendors who sell winter clothes, jackets, antique collections, dresses, and foods. If we bargain more, you may get it for a very low cost. Still, I think these are the lowest priced winter jackets and gloves available compared to Delhi or other places. If you are planning to visit Jammu and Kashmir in the winter, you should buy your winter clothes here for a cheaper price than elsewhere. There are some good restaurants that have tasty food. Never miss the opportunity to stay at Dal Lake, at least for one night. Not everyone likes to spend more than one night at the lake, as we need to take a shikara to reach the road and come back to the houseboat. Our houseboat offered complimentary drop-off and pick-up service to the dock and vice versa.

Where can I first go at Srinagar??
Only one answer for this - Dal Lake.
It's the top attraction in Srinagar. This beautiful place is known as the ""Jewel in the crown of Kashmir"".
The colorful Shikaras (boats) made this place more beautiful.
I don't have a second thought, I decided to stay here in Dal lake. I need that lake vibes.
You can find lots of house boats in Dal lake for stay. It is very cheap also.
For solo traveler like me this was th best choice.
I booked a cheap houseboat there in Gate number 12. Because I will land in Srinagar in the afternoon, so I won't get time to find a stay for that day. That's why I booked it in advance. It is better to book your first day stay in most of the time.",2 years ago,2022-10-24T00:08:15,,,null,1,87,4330,1,null,null

Weed and foul smell makes the experience not so pleasant. When you book a Shikara (boat with seating) do not forget to make sure that there will be no forced marketing. The moment your boat reaches 10 meters inside it will be surrounded by other boats blocking your view and asking you to buy things that are priced atleast four times higher than usual. At first I thought it was just a coincidence but its a well planned thing. You get rid of one and other boat comes in. Also the boats providing eatables are fleecing big time.

A Himalayan urban lake, it has five basins and a number of channels that are well linked with each other. There are plenty of fishes in Dal Lake and fishery is the second largest industry of the region centered on the lake. The sparkling quiet waters of Dal surrounded by snow-capped mountains on its three sides, undoubtedly mark it as one of the most beautiful lakes of India. It is also the second largest lake in the State of Jammu and Kashmir with numerous gardens and orchards all along its shores. Houseboats form an indelible part of the scenery of the Dal Lake that are always ready to take tourists to a romantic and peaceful ride of the lake and soothe their nerves as the houseboat floats over the slightly rippling waters. They also offer some of the most exotic views of the splendid scenery of the Dal Lake.

There are Shikaras that look like small ornate versions of the gondolas of Venice that offers ferry rides to and from the banks of the lake to the houseboats. The shores of the Lake houses the distinct Moghul monuments and the campus of the Kashmir University while the two hillocks overlooking the lake house Shankar Acharya and Hari Parbat temples. The glorious Mughal gardens on its shores contribute to the beauty of the Dal Lake. Out of about five hundred gardens laid down in 16th to 17th century, only a few still survive. There have been controversies about the origin of the Dal Lake. While some geologists believe that the origins of Dal Lake lie in the Pleistocene Oligotrophic Lake that once covered the entire valley of Kashmir, others just believe it to be a flood plain lake. The floating gardens of Dal Lake are considered a beauty in themselves. One can find a number of restaurants and hotels at the lakefront that have sprung up, encouraged by the large influx of tourists here.",2 years ago,2022-10-24T00:08:17,,,null,3,31,90,1,null,null

Visited in feb 2nd week. Temp is quite low at night.
Tourist flow - Low

Tip:
1. If you want to stay in houseboat, choose the one on Ghat 17. It has spending view. (Stayed in LIGHTHOUSE HOUSEBOAT, direct booking will give you best price)
2. Shikara Ride - Generally houseboat will include 1 hr Shikara Ride in you stay.
You should go for the Ride in the morning around 6-7 AM to experience there Mandi (farmers sell their vegetation to vegetable sellers)
3. Be aware of hawkers, DONT BUY ANYTHING (saffron, shawls etc)
4. 1.5 hrs should be enough. The have made other points to charge extra from tourist. (E.g. Mission Kashmir point, its a houseboat where shoot was done, nothing else)
5. There is a small food joint in the floating market called Quick ready. It serves delicious Tea, coffee, Paneer pakode with chutney",2 years ago,2022-10-24T00:08:18,,,null,3,133,90,1,null,null

The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras. During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches 11 degC (12 degF), freezing the lake.

The lake covers an area of 18 SQ kimi and is part of a floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nigeen (although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake).

In my view, it was a little overrated. It could be because when you hire a Shikara and start from Dalgate, its a a bit of a drag until you enter the main area, thats where it widens into an open landscape which is lovely to watch. The lakes have got algae all the way upto the surface, so it doesn't give you the best feeling, but I also feel it could be because tourism is still in revival phase as a result of Covid-19 and maintenance wasnt done regularly. I arrived from Mumbai and got this out of the bucket list on the arrival day itself. U can lay back and relax on the Shikara and maximize your visiting places in Kashmir for the remainder of your stay. Watch out for hawkers cornering your Shikara every possible chance and offering goods for sale. Recommended to avoid them - whether its handicrafts or kebabs or photos in local costumes. The ride through the lake is not worth it for more than 2 hrs max. The Shikara riders show points which are to be enjoyed in person not gawked at from the lake. Only go for places situated on the lake, detox yourself for a solid 2 hrs and go back.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:03,,,null,7,322,1391,1,null,null

We booked Mughal Sheraton house boat in advance so they gave us pick up at the lake pick up point. Then the shikara person took us on Lake tour. We saw many shikara shops on our way and we bought few things from them we also had chicken tikka from one shikara shop it was delicious. We had kesar kava. We saw meena bazar which was on shikaras. Saw shikara boats for the first time in life. It was very nice experience overall. Would love to visit dal lake in summers as well to experience summer weather.

In summers, it is recommended to take the Shikara ride in the evening as afternoons can be hot. One has to be very careful while visiting for the first time as Shikara owners ask for huge sums for a simple ride. The price is not more than Rs.200 for half An hour but they always quote 1700 or even more. Also another annoying thing is the hawkers pestering you while you enjoy the Shikara ride. Everything they sell is cheap and fake so dont pay a dime for it. It is absolutely ok to be be dismissive even if you think you are being rude.

Situated in Srinagar in Kashmir, Dal Lake stretches to a length of around 7 kms with a width of 3.5 kms. Since Moghul times Dal Lake has been an attraction because of its beauty and aptly named 'Jewel in the crown of Kashmir'

As seen in many Bollywood films, the Dal Lake is pristine with floating gardens, house boats and shikaras. Around 30 percent of the lake is covered with lotus plants. The Dal Lake makes Srinagar a popular tourist spot. Since the British times, the Houseboats are of immense tourist attraction. These houseboats are large boats with luxurious rooms and sprawling decks for sunbathing. These boats are usually anchored on the shores. The shikaras or the small boats form the means of transportation to the houseboats and islands and also of smaller commercial activities on the lake. They are also popular for taking spending leisure time and taking a boat ride on among the gardens.

Commercial activities on Dal Lake

Tourism is of course the biggest commercial activity. The lake is surrounded by picturesque boulevards. The other attractions at the lake include the island with four Cedars, named Char Chinar. The Shalimar gardens along the lake and the smaller Nagin Lake also attracts many tourists.

For religious travellers the Hazratbal shrine is a much frequented place, as also the Shankaracharya Temple.

The floating gardens are made out of earth with matted roots but they are not anchored to the bottom of the lake. They are used for growing vegetables like cucumbers and others that need a lot of water. The water of Dal Lake being nutrient-rich, plants thrive on it.

Problems with Dal Lake

Pollution from the sewers and other dumps has become a problem for the lake over the last few decades but is being met successfully.

Eutrophication is the other big problem because of the high nutrients found in the water. The excessive growth of plants and algae on the surface form a green cover and the water surface gets hidden. This too is being dealt with especially from the large investment made by the government of India for the restoration of the lake.

Dal Lake is an important lake not just for its beauty but also from a religious point of view for many Indians, its shores supposed to be the residence of Goddess Durga.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:37,,,null,11,133,2241,1,null,null

Its a unique in its own kind. Dal Lake is situated in the heart of the srinagar city. The Lake is the main attraction for the tourist in srinagar.

Dal Lake Morphology :
Visitors may be surprised to find that Dal Lake is a single body of water as it has the appearance of being many different lakes and pools interconnected and divided by numerous causeways, buildings on stilts, floating gardens and houseboats.
The lake is actually formed from five lake basins these being the Nehru Park, Nishat, Hazratbal, Nagin and Brari. The lake is shallow with a depth of around 6m and it currently has an area of around 16 sq km although it has previously covered an area of around 22 sq km.

Access to Dal Lake:
Being an urban lake, it is easily accessible with roads running around it and reaching this part of the world is fairly easy with a good road network and an airport just 7 km away at Badgam. It should be noted however that no rail service operates in this region.

Dal Lake House Boats
The first houseboats appeared during the days of British colonial rule when the beauty of this part of the country lured many of the British but the Maharaja of Kashmir strictly controlled the building of houses. The British overcame such restrictions by simply taking to the water. Each of the early houseboats were built in a particularly British style leading to them being described as ""each a little piece of England"". Today's houseboats continue to offer accommodation and style seemingly from an earlier age. Many visitors choose to stay at one of these unique floating homes but there are also good quality hotels and restaurants on the lake-front.
Spending time on the water is a priority for most people and one of the favourite modes of transport is the shikava boat which has been described as the gondola of Kashmir. The owners of houseboats invariably provide shikavas for the use of their guests and others are available for hire at reasonable, although usually negotiable, rates.

What to See at Dal Lake:
There are many interesting places to visit such as the ancient temple of Shankaracharya or the masses of lotus flowers which bloom in July and August. The lake also has many floating gardens often moored in close proximity to the houseboats. These gardens are created from sections of matted vegetation which are simply cut free and manoeuvred into position. Perhaps unsurprisingly, water loving crops such as melons, cucumbers and tomatoes seem to grow particularly well in these conditions.
There is always a great deal of activity on the lake and it even hosts a floating market where vendors sell their produce, directly from their boats. In some areas, swimming is popular as is canoeing and other forms of boating. During the winter months, there may even be the opportunity for skiing.

When to Visit Dal Lake
The most popular time to visit Dal Lake is between June and August when the weather is probably at its most pleasant. Average summer temperatures range from 12 to 30 degrees Celsius making this a pleasant escape from the scorching summer temperatures found in much of India. Most people seem to agree with the old Maharaja on his choice of summer retreat.

Winter however has its own attractions and this is when the spectacular scenery can be experienced at its magnificent best. Winter temperatures average around 1 to 11 degrees Celsius but during a harsh winter, temperatures can drop as low as minus 11 degrees and at such temperatures, the surface of the lake can freeze. Needless to say, venturing onto the frozen surface can be extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without taking specialist advice from local experts.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:38,,,null,0,105,1542,1,null,null

It is an urban lake, which is the second largest in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is integral to tourism and recreation in Kashmir and is named the Lake of Flowers, Jewel in the crown of Kashmir or Srinagars JewelFans of Bollywood movies may wonder just where the film makers find such incredible backdrops and the sight of primitive boats traversing a mirror-like lake complete with the reflections of immense snow-covered mountains seems to be a million miles away from most people's idea of modern India but Dal Lake is unlike any other place on earth. It is situated far in the north of India in the state of Jammu and Kashmir overlooked by the mighty Himalayas.Visitors may be surprised to find that Dal Lake is a single body of water as it has the appearance of being many different lakes and pools interconnected and divided by numerous causeways, buildings on stilts, floating gardens and houseboats.

The lake is actually formed from five lake basins these being the Nehru Park, Nishat, Hazratbal, Nagin and Brari. The lake is shallow with a depth of around 6m and it currently has an area of around 16 sq km although it has previously covered an area of around 22 sq km.Being an urban lake, it is easily accessible with roads running around it and reaching this part of the world is fairly easy with a good road network and an airport just 7 km away at Badgam. It should be noted however that no rail service operates in this region.The lake is a major attraction for tourism and recreation and although it also offers some commercial uses such as fishing and weed harvesting for compost making, these are of secondary significance. Perhaps the most defining feature of the lake from the point of view of tourism is the sight of hundreds of houseboats moored close to the shorelines.The first houseboats appeared during the days of British colonial rule when the beauty of this part of the country lured many of the British but the Maharaja of Kashmir strictly controlled the building of houses. The British overcame such restrictions by simply taking to the water. Each of the early houseboats were built in a particularly British style leading to them being described as ""each a little piece of England"". Today's houseboats continue to offer accommodation and style seemingly from an earlier age. Many visitors choose to stay at one of these unique floating homes but there are also good quality hotels and restaurants on the lake-front.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:42,,,null,0,51,295,1,null,null

It is difficult to find a person who has been to Srinagar but has not ridden a shikara at Dal Lake. That area of   Dal Lake looks so wonderful that no matter how many times you visit it, it never gets old. It is very fun to walk along the long road called Boulevard Road by the lake. Shikaras are roaming in the wobbly water of the lake, rows of houseboats floating in the water are waiting for tourists, rows of mountains in the far distance, four Chinas like an island in the middle of the lake will keep you enthralled. When I went to Kashmir for the first time in 1989, Kashmir was very calm, the riots had not yet started. We used to leave Srinagar every morning and visit Pahelgao, Gulmarg and Shonmarg and return to Srinagar at the end of the day. Even then we had no idea how turbulent Kashmir was going to be in a few years. Then in 2010, when I went to Leh by car from Srinagar, I did not go to Pahelgao or Gulmarg. I had the eyes of a service bird, so I didnt want to go anywhere else to waste time or hurt my body. Because there was a huge impassable road ahead, more than 1000 km. It was starting from Srinagar, going around Leh and returning via Manali, Chandigarh. We stayed in Srinagar for three days. Visited Shankaracharya Temple, Mughal Garden and Dal Lake. There was a lot of chaos in Kashmir at that time. All around the army is standing guard with raised rifles. A funny incident happened while riding Shikara at Dal Lake. It was the end of May. At that time, the tourists in Srinagar have decreased a lot, because the monsoons have almost started, but this is the ideal time to visit Leh. We took Shikara for an hour in the afternoon, she was supposed to turn things around, her name seems to be Sahel. At the back of the lake, many shopkeepers have set up their shops. Beyond them the hunters are advancing deeper. It was almost evening and the place was so deserted that my Ginni got up and screamed in fear, what is the mans intention, tell him to turn the hunters at once etc. Seeing that there was no one else around, I was also a little nervous. I asked Sahel in a harsh voice to quickly turn Shikara. He must have understood something, he just said like Babuji Doro Mat, Aplog Hamara Mehman. I was very ashamed to hear this. In fact there is no comparison to the customs or hospitality of real Kashmiris. I have never been in any danger by trusting them.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:43,,,null,2,370,7371,1,"ddaal lek ebN kaashmiirii aatitheyytaa

People are very friendly over there. I was there for 3 days and enjoyed the ride of 7-8 shikaras day & Night. Other shikaras passing by you sell snacks-beers and all kinds of stuff. I also stayed in the houseboat, it was an altogether different experience. that houseboat was so beautiful, a wooden piece of art.

The surrounding environment around the lake is interesting with beautiful scenery that good for spending time relaxing there. Mornings will never be the same again after u wake up to the sun rising over the beautiful Dal Lake. Life is laid back easy and also beautiful. Lake itself is beautiful with colorful boats, scenic mountains in the background, and many shops in boats. The best time is to take around the evening 1 hour before the sunset when the lake is quiet and the weather is nice. Dal lake itself is quite huge and provides some stunning views. If you are in Srinagar, this is a must-visit.

there are many ghats ( kind of Taxi Stop stand), starting from 1 to 16.. I was there at Ghat-12...

Be careful with shopping recommendations by the drivers. They literally force you to buy. also, there is a floating market, where shikara riders will take you. just like Bangkok and other countries floating market,

Better go to Lal Chowk.
I want to share my experience with one shikara rider. As everyone knows the Kashmir issue and how people over there support Pakistan. The rider asked me, aur Sahab Ji, aapka desh kaisa hai  (Sir, how is your country). I was shocked as I told him, is Kashmir in another country and then we argued for 5 minutes, my elder brother make me shut up and said teasingly, don't argue with fool, he ll drown his boat and you can't do anything.

Main features:
Reckoned to be the pride of Kashmir tourism, Dal Lake is the most popular attraction in Srinagar. Enclosed by splendid Pir Panjal mountains and Mughal Gardens, this must-see place is ideal for family vacationers, honeymoon couples, and even for solo travellers seeking peace.

Dal Lake is also one of the best locations in Kashmir for film shooting as it offers some incredible vistas of lofty rolling hills, the distant snow-capped mountains, shikaras cruising quietly and the houseboat standing still with the perfect poise.

The canopied Shikaras sailing on the lake are one of the major attractions of Dal Lake. The houseboats on the lake are also the top attraction as the best accommodation option in Srinagar to the tourists.

Along with being a popular tourist attraction for nature lovers, Dal Lake even invites the fishing enthusiast with its plethora of fishes along with Carp. In addition to this, the floating vegetable and flower market is a major place to see.

The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the Wular Lake. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city.

There are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the Dal, the Nigeen, the Anchar, Khushal Sar, Gil Sar and Hokersar.

Hokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds.

Hokersar is 14 km (8.7 mi) north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over 13.75 km2 (5.31 sq mi) including lake and marshy area. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmirs wetlands which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years.[37]

Road

The city is served by many highways, including National Highway 1A and National Highway 1D.[58]

Air

Srinagar International Airport has regular domestic flights to Leh, Jammu, Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai and occasional international flights. An expanded terminal capable of handling both domestic and international flights was inaugurated on 14 February 2009 with Air India Express flights to Dubai. Hajj flights also operate from this airport to Saudi Arabia.[59]

Rail

Main articles: Srinagar railway station and Srinagar Metro

Srinagar is a station on the 119 km (74 mi) long Banihal-Baramulla line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla to Srinagar, Anantnag and Qazigund. The railway track also connects to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through a newly constructed 11 km long Banihal tunnel, and subsequently to the Indian railway network after a few years. It takes approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds for a train to cross the tunnel. It is the longest rail tunnel in India. This railway system, proposed in 2001, is not expected to connect the Indian railway network until 2017 at the earliest, with a cost overrun of 55 billion INR.[60] The train also runs during heavy snow.

There are proposals to develop a metro system in the city.[61] The feasibility report for the Srinagar Metro is planned to be carried out by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.[62]",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:52,,,null,1,152,249,1,null,null

It has four major reservoirs: Gagaribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nagin. Ruplank Island is located in the middle of Lokut Dal and Sonalank Island is located in the middle of Bod Dal reservoir. It is named after one of the most beautiful lakes in India. The beauty of Dal Sarovar looks unparalleled from the nearby Mughal Vatika. It is not uncommon for a tourist to come to Jammu and Kashmir and visit Dal Sarovar. [1]

The main attraction of Dal Sarovar is the hunting or houseboat. Passengers can enjoy the lake by staying in these houseboats. Nehru Park, Kanutur Khana, Charchinari Islands and Hazrat Bal can also be visited. Extra stores are also available for hunting and a variety of items can be purchased on the hunt. A variety of vegetation enhances the beauty of Dal Sarovar. The lotus flower, the lily flowing in the water, adds four moons to the beauty of the lake. A variety of recreational facilities for hikers such as kayaking, canoeing, water surfing and fishing are available here. Apart from tourism, Dal Sarovar is mainly used for fishing.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:00:53,,,null,10,58,861,1,null,null

Multiple theories explaining the origin of this lake have been formulated. One version is that it is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory is that it is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum river.
The lake is an important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant harvesting.
Inflow Channel Telbal Nallah from Marsar lake.
Outflow is regulated by two channels Dal Gate and Nalla Amir.
The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels.
Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Jahangir.
During the Mughal period, the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir, Srinagar in particular, as their summer resort. They developed the precincts of the Dal in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal-type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to enjoy the salubrious cool climate.
The ecosystem of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. Macrophyte flora recorded in the lakes aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August",3 years ago,2021-10-24T02:01:05,,,null,1,102,362,1,null,null

You guys must visit there, its mind blowing.

For explore Dal lake and stunning views you must go there before sunrise or by evening before sunset

I prefer june,july,August for visits Dal lake at the time of blossom

If you want to stay over night in Dal lake you can book a house boat n stay there -like a hotel experience.For that you can make booking prior-to visit

The houseboats and shikaras are a main focus of the lake. The Shikara ride is one of a kind. You can view the lake from inside in shikaras. The houseboats are a luxurious place to live for toruists in the Dal Lake.

But now a days, due to encroachment of the lake its span is continuously decreasing. Another problem is the dirt and affluent dumped in the Dal Lake which pollutes the Dal and makes it filthy and smelly.

We stayed on the ALPS Houseboat on Dal lake, during our brief stay in Srinagar. The lake is as beautiful as ever. The top layer was frozen in the morning and it was one of an experience to ride the shikara moving through the frozen..
Serene and peaceful.Natural beauty with a majestic view. A great boat ride to enjoy the daily life of local people

we went to take the shikara ride. The shikara we took was ""PATLOO PALACE"" rowed by two cute old gentlemen. The dal lake, the surrounding mountains gave a spectacular view of the lake. It felt like we are floating in heaven. There are totally 6points in dal lake and they asked us 2500, but we managed to bargain it to 2000. There is no time limit. The fun part was that while you are tanking the shikara ride, there will be many different Shikaras and salesmen who will approach you and try to sell their handicrafts. please bargain the price with them...!! You can also get down and shop or eat on the Shikaras which are fixed there, also known as the houseboats. There is a Nehru garden in the middle of the lake, which is free entry. It's just a small garden .. get down take pics, eat in the restaurant and that's it.

Initially, the place of Dal was a waterless plain and it is called Vatial Murg. Later, the lake was formed by the springs and streams that came down from the mountains and gradually it took the form of a large and beautiful lake, which is about 5 miles in length and 2.5 miles in width. The depth of this lake, located in the north-west of Srinagar, will be around 15 lakh feet. In Badi-Nazar, it has divided Srinagar into two parts. But at a short distance it also divides itself into two parts. One part is called Chota Dal and the other part is called Big Dal.

Its depth continues to decrease at various places. Syed Mahmood Azad has written while describing the auspicious environment of this lake and its wonderful conditions:
The charm created by the small farms floating on the water on the banks of Jheel Dal is beyond human reach. In these fields, the boatmen here, who are called Hanji in Kashmiri language, cultivate various vegetables. The scene of these fields dancing on Lake Dal looks just like the nature artist himself has landed in the lake and started dancing. When the kadam leaves sway from the bamboo in these floating fields, their reflection is seen in the dal water just like the green fairies dancing on the surface of the water, but all this is a refreshing and soulful scene. Spring festivals are auspicious because in winter, when the frozen waves rise from Lake Dal, no one goes near it.",4 years ago,2020-10-24T02:01:47,,,null,8,362,1412,1,"mqbwDh khshmyr khy drlHkhwmt sr yngr khy aayn wsT myN wqaa ddl jhyl khshmyr kh y'ynh hy wr s khy shff pny myN sry khshmyr khy raany'yN jhlkhty hyN .

The city of Srinagar is actually the summer capital of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The Srinagar is a valley drained by the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus River. The valley amidst the high and snowy mountain, filled with lush green pasture is truly paradise like. At the centre of Srinagar city lies the most beautiful fresh water lake of the whole India, the Dal Lake. It is without any doubt, the main attraction of Srinagar and the hotspot of Jammu & Kashmir Tourism.

The Dal Lake is a fresh water lake in the catchment of Jhelum and on its banks the main city has flourished. The water of the lake is very clear and in reality it is a segregation of three lakes joined by maze level intricate water channels. The Dal Lake is very beautiful and it is very picturesque with a back drop of high White Mountains.

The main attraction of the Dal Lake is the Char Chinar and the floating vegetation. Char Chinar is a lake island ate the centre housing very old four chinar trees. The floating vegetation serves both beauty and ecological purposes for the lake. The whole tourism industry of Srinagar is built in the lake.

The houseboats are best accommodation for the travelers, the floating gardens are best beautification for the trips and roaming the lake on elegant & aristocratic Shikaras is just the epitome of Srinagar visit for the tourists. Apart from these the market place on the lake is also a great tourist magnate and to make Dal Lake further engaging, the tourist will be offered to taste the mouth-watering cuisines of local delicacy.",4 years ago,2020-10-24T02:01:55,,,null,0,724,null,,null,null

The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres, is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches 11 degC (12 degF), freezing the lake.
The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres , including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nigeen (although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank respectively.
Basically its a very beautiful place surrounded with serenity of nature. The amazing fact is that, you get to see different senery of nature in each season.

Dal Lake Located in Srinagar city, which is 6.4 km long and 4km wide, and within its periphery, four enormous expanses of water - Lokut Dal, Bod Dal, Gagribal and Nagin. Hence, Dal Lake is not a flat, continuous mass of water, but an intricate maze of waterways, making for a spectacular sight and an even more enchanting locale to explore.To the delight of the visitors they can enjoy fascinating rides on traditional Kashmiri Houseboats and Shikaras. The Shikara ride can be an hour-long sightseeing session of the Dal a shopping-by-shikara expedition to handicraft shops within the lake area; or a whole-day trip featuring visits to major landmarks in Srinagar.

This beautiful lake of Kashmir valley is revered not only for its spectacular beauty, but also for its vibrancy, because within its periphery, the lake sustains a unique life, unmatched elsewhere. The Houseboat and Shikhara communities have lived for ages on the Dal, and have created such a complete infrastructure that they do not need to step on land for their day-to-day sustenance.",4 years ago,2020-10-24T02:01:59,,,null,1,100,229,1,null,null

The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of MughalEmperor Jahangir[7] and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.[8] During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches 11 degC (12 degF), freezing the lake.[6][9]

The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi) and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi), including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causewaysinto four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Daland Nigeen (although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank respectively.[9][10]

At present, the Dal and its Mughal gardens, Shalimar Bagh and the Nishat Bagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake. Massive investments of approximately US$275 million ( 11 billion) are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its original splendour.[6][9][10][11",5 years ago,2019-10-24T02:02:04,,,null,1,579,null,,null,null

The urban lake, which is the second largest in the union territory, is integral to tourism and recreation in Kashmir and is named the  Lake of Flowers ,Jewel in the crown of Kashmiror Srinagars JewelThe lake is also an important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant harvesting.The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres 9.6 mi, is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of MughalEmperor Jahangirand from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches 11 degC 12 degF, freezing the lake.
The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres 6.9 sq mi and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres 8.1 sq mi, including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causewaysinto four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Daland Nigeen although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake. Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank or Char Chinari and Sona Lank respectively.
At present, the Dal and its Mughal gardens, Shalimar Bagh and the Nishat Bagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake. Massive investments of approximately US$275 million  11 billion are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its original splendour.Dal is mentioned as Mahasarit (Sanskrti-mhaasrit) in ancient Sanskrit texts. Ancient history records mention that a village named Isabar to the east of Dal was the residence of goddess Durga.This place was known as Sureshwari on the bank of the lake, which was sourced by a spring called the Satadhara.
During the Mughal period, the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir, Srinagar in particular, as their summer resort. They developed the precincts of the Dal in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal-type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to enjoy the salubrious cool climate.After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, which led to the disintegration of the Mughal Empire,Pashtun tribes in the area around the lake and city increased, and the Afghan Durrani Empireruled the city for several decades.In 1814 a significant part of the Kashmir valley, including Srinagar, was annexed from the Afghans by Raja Ranjit Singh to his kingdom, and the Sikhs grew in influence in the region for 27 years.During the Dogra Raj, Srinagar became the capital of Dogra dynasty, attracted by the cool climate of the Kashmir valley, amidst the back drop of the majestic snow covered Himalayan ranges. The lake precincts experience temperatures in the range of 1-11 degC 34-52 degF during winter and 12-30 degC 54-86 degF during the summer season. The lake freezes when temperatures drop to about 11 degC 12 degF during severe winter.Although the Dogra Maharaja of Kashmir restricted the building of houses in the valley, the British circumvented this rule by commissioning lavish houseboats to be built on the Dal. The houseboats have been referred to as, each one a little piece of England afloat on Dal.
After the independence of India, the Kashmiri Hanji people have built, owned and maintained these houseboats, cultivating floating gardens and producing commodities for the market, making them the centre of their livelihoods. The houseboats, closely associated with Dal also provide accommodation in Srinagar. Following the Mughal, Afghan, Sikh and Dogra rule, the place has earned the epithet, Jewel in the crown of Kashmir.",5 years ago,2019-10-24T02:02:07,,,null,0,65,661,1,null,null

It is the second largest lake in the state and is considered one of its most important tourism and entertainment destinations. It is called ""the jewel in the crown of Kashmir"" or ""the jewel of Srinagar"". The lake is also an important commercial source for fishing and harvesting aquatic plants.

The lakes shoreline is located on an area of   about 15.5 kilometers (9.6 mi) and includes Mughal-era gardens, houseboats, and a number of hotels. The lake offers stunning views, so you can see a number of nearby villages and boats sailing along the lake in its attractive colors. During the winter season, temperatures drop sometimes to -11 degrees Celsius and the lake freezes.

Covering an area of   18 km2 (6.9 sq mi), Dal Lake is part of the 21.1 km2 (8.1 sq mi) natural water park that includes floating gardens, known as radh in Kashmir and covered during the months of July and August with lotus blossoms. The water areas are divided through bridges into four basins. They are Lokot Dal, Gagripal, Budh Dal and Naagin. The Lokot Dal and Bud Dal basins have islands in their center called ""Rup Lank"" and ""Sona Lank"" respectively.

Currently, Dal Lake and the Mughal Gardens adjacent to it are undergoing intensive measures to address the serious problems of eutrophication that the lake suffers from, and a huge investment of about US$ 275 million is currently being made by the Indian government to restore the lake to its original splendor.",5 years ago,2019-10-24T02:02:10,,,null,0,50,122,1,"bHyr@ dl bHyr@ fy mdyn@ srynGr bwly@ kshmyr why thny 'kbr bHyr@ fy lwly@ wtaatbr mn 'hm wjht lsyH@ wltrfyh fyh, wyTlq aalyh sm jwhr@ fy tj kshmyr 'w jwhr@ srynGr. km 'n lbHyr@ 'yDan taatbr mSdr tjry hm fy mjl Syd l'smk wHSd lnbtt lmy'y@.

This is Dal Lake- the jewel of Kashmir. Its magnificent beauty and captivating aura have enchanted visitors from ages.
Are you interested in knowing more about this lake? Here are a few quick facts to give you a sneak-peek:
1. Dal lake is not just one lake but, it is a union of three lakes. It is divided into two more parts, the Lokut and Bod Dal. This is the second largest lake in Jammu and Kashmir and receives its water supply from the mountain lake Mar Sar. When visiting the Dal lake, you'll find it an enchanting maze consisting of intricate waterways, numerous channels, and floating islands. Dal Lake is also popular for fishing activities and is also used for harvesting water plants.

The line of the lake is hemmed by beautiful flower gardens, hotels, and parks. The gardens around it were built in the pre-independence era. The most famous of them is the Shalimar Bagh. You can also enjoy a great view of the Dal Lake from Shalimar Bagh. During winter, when the temperature dips down to -11 degree celcius, the lake freezes. You can enjoy skiing on the frozen surface of the Dal lake.

3. This lake is spread over an area of 18 square kilometers and also covers the area of a wetland of around 21.1 square kilometers. This wetland includes all the floating gardens and water plantation. If you visit Dal lake during the month of July, you will find these floating gardens covered in flowers of different hues. There is abundance of vegetation all across the lake. You will find trees like Pine, Cupressus, Gerardiana, Celtis to name a few.

4. In ancient scriptures, Dal lake is considered as Mahasarit. According to the scriptures, there was a village named Isabar in the eastern part of the lake and was a residence of Goddess Durga.

5. The Mughals took great care in designing the state of Kashmir. Since Srinagar was frequented by people due to its scenic beauty, the Mughals designed lakes and adjoining gardens for making the place more picturesque. Dal lake was one of them.",5 years ago,2019-10-24T02:02:12,,,null,1,4,322,1,null,null

Located within the city of Srinagar its an incredible jewel of a lake, with intricately carved wooden houseboats lined up along the Boulevard side and beyond, and decorated canoes called shikaras which ply the lake taking people to and from the houseboats or just around the lake and backwaters for a unique sightseeing experience. BUT, despite the beautiful mountain backdrop and serene waters topped with lilies and over flown by brightly coloured kingfishers this is where the idyll ends. To walk along the Boulevard is to subject yourself to a continuous wave of hassle and disturbance. The shikara touts, tuk tuk drivers and houseboat owners are literally wall to wall along the Boulevard and it is a constant plague of harassment rather than a pleasant walk. Ive learned to just walk by each ghat (shikara mooring station where you get transport to and from your houseboat if youre brave (or mad!) enough to risk putting yourself through a stay on one of these floating white elephants) with my hand up saying no, no, no before they get a chance to open their mouths because Ive become tired of smiling and being nice to them all. Its an absolute den of creepiness totally absorbed by how much money they can extract from you, and it isnt a pleasant experience at all. The houseboats themselves? Well, theyre a whole other story with issues of their own! Ive given Dal Lake an average rating rather than lower because it IS outstandingly beautiful beyond the people who are ruining and exploiting it. Its worth a visit to see a unique place but 2 days is enough!

Kashmir / Srinagar has always remained the ""jannat"" or heaven for an average Indian. The beautiful locations, cool climates varied colours of nature. You have everything for a romantic gateway. Add Dal lake to it and you have a perfect spot.
Dal lake is collections of many basins and covers an area of roughly 20 Sqr kms. It has everything: House boats , floating markets, park , restaurants, agriculture ""fields"". You think of it and you have it. Including defence base.
You have all the items on sale. So , you may get fresh fruit salad or Maggi. You may decide to order a walnut table for your home or you surprise your partner with a kashmiri dress. Choices are unlimited.
The ancient Shankaracharya temple stands as a guardian and a sentinel to this lake and area around this.
During summers , one can enjoy the salubrious climate boat ride. During winter , this is definitely chilly. In extreme season , the lake also freezes. I have met people who claim that they have sat on the frozen lake or played cricket.

Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir[6] and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.[7]During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches 11 degC (12 degF), freezing the lake.[5][8]

The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi) and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi), including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as Rad in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nigeen (although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lankrespectively.[8][9]

At present, the Dal and its Mughal gardens, Shalimar Bagh and the Nishat Bagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake. Massive investments of approximately US$275 million ( 11 billion) are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its original splendour.",5 years ago,2019-10-24T02:02:31,,,null,3,129,772,1,null,null

The shoreline is 15.5 km long that covers a 21.1sqkm of natural wetlands. The lake is surrounded by gardens, greenery and houseboats. The mode of transport from land to the houseboats via the colorful shikaras.
I stayed for two nights at the houseboat, complete with a butler and a cook. It was not a nice experience staying at the houseboat as the owner kept pestering me to buy leather bags from his son, to the point of harrasing me.
But I want to focus on the beautiful lake. The water is clear and turquiose. The colorful shikaras adds substance to the whole landscape.
I enjoyed the one-hour shikara ride very much and bought a silver crowned-precious stone ring.
We stopped at some of the floating shops for shawls and fridge magnets.
I love it as it is a different kind of shopping experience, parking the shikara, instead of a car.
I love the smooth and peaceful ride in the shikara, except for the occasional disturbance from the floating traders. Once, they are ignored, the ride was wonderful.
Once back at the Dock to the houseboat, I just stood and watch the lake, the birds, the shikaras and the absolute beauty at the Lake Dal. It was totally mesmerising as the lake is kept clear and clean. I suppose it is a concerted efforts from the authorities as well as the people living at the lake.

SHIKARA BOAT RIDE

font size Print Email

The Dal is famous not only for its beauty, but for its vibrance, because it sustains within its periphery, a life that is unique anywhere in the world. The houseboat and shikara communities have lived for centuries on the Dal, and so complete is their infrastructure on the lake, that they never have to step on land! Doctors, tailors, and bakers - youll see them all in tiny wooden shops on the lake, near picturesque vegetable gardens and acres of lotus gardens.

A shikara ride is one of the most soothing, relaxing aspects of a holiday in Kashmir. Shikaras are long boats which crowd the Srinagar lakes. They are used for getting back and forth from the houseboats or for longer tours. It is worth to take a pleasure ride around the lake in shikara. Shikara is a Gondola type light rowing boat. The two hour boat ride takes tourists on a relaxing sightseeing tour of interior parts of the calm and placid waters of Dal Lake, and be part of shopping- by-shikara expeditions. Because the Dal is so central to the landscape of Srinagar, many places of tourist interest have, over the ages, been built in its vicinity. Nishat and Shalimar gardens as well as Hazratbal mosque are directly accessible by shikara. Mostly crowded, the Shikara boat rides in Kashmir are also used to transport you from land to your houseboat and vice versa. It is worth your time and money to take that joyride ride around the lakes of Kashmir in a shikara. You can also access tourist spots like the Shalimar Garden, Nishat Garden, and the Hazratbal mosque via the Shikara as the Dal Lake is quite central to these places in Srinagar.

While riding on Shikara we can often observe white breasted Kingfishers (Halycon smyrnensis), large striking birds with robust bills perched on the branches of willow trees. These birds concentrate their efforts to hunting on the floating Gardens. These man made islands comprise of reeds, willow rods, aquatic vegetations and and held together with humus consisting of mud from the lake bottom. This is extremely fertile and provide rich source of food in the form of frogs,lizards,mice, grasshoppers and other insects to the Kingfisher.

Sightseeing on a shikara boat in Dal Lake and Nagin lakes culminates to a romantic trip especially if you are seated inside canopies of the Dal lake shikara boats. The feeling of joy and pleasure is unaccountable and the experience definitely unforgettable. The banks of the Dal Lake and Nagin Lake along the Boulevard road in Srinagar, Kashmir feature several Shikara Boat Ghats where the boats are available for hire. There are three main Shikara boat Ghats such as the Dal Gate, Nagin Lake, Hazratbal, Nehru Park, and Gagribal.",6 years ago,2018-10-24T02:02:34,,,null,4,230,2128,1,null,null

The shikara( boat ride) is costly. We paid Rs.3600 for a boat for 6 people after much negotiations. It was worth or not but definitely a must do thing in srinagar.
The boat is not motorised that is quite good, only man propelled it slowly and slowly.
Sound of paddle in water amidst calmness of valley, and you sipping kahwa is something to feel.
Its not only lake but cumulative effect of surrounding landscapes that make it a worth. Boathouses are all along shore of lake.

Dal lake is economy growing on water. You can get many food items selling on movable boat, even Beer.
They will give you a tour of lake, various shops and a few farms raised on water.

The irony with a tourist place is it doesnt remains the same over the period.
Boathouses, Tourist, Residents dumping garbage in lake destroying its beauty and ecology.

I had a wonderful experience boating around the lake. Our guide (the person who manages the boat) was very kind, enthusiastic and informative.
Listen carefully to everything they say and it could lead to wonderful conversations about the local culture and their history.
They usually offer 3 variants in the ride (based on duration and distance), in my opinion, the 2nd variant should do just fine.
Make sure you have your camera/phone charged!",8 years ago,2016-10-24T02:02:56,,,null,17,561,3896,1,null,null
