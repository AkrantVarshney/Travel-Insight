Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this majestic mausoleum is a symbol of eternal love and architectural brilliance. Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

The structure's beauty lies in its perfect symmetry, intricate marble work, and stunning gardens. Made from white marble, the Taj Mahal reflects changing hues depending on the time of day and the light, making it a visual treat at sunrise, sunset, and even under moonlight. The central dome, flanked by four minarets, along with the detailed carvings and calligraphy, showcases the pinnacle of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles.

The interior of the Taj Mahal is equally mesmerizing, with inlaid precious stones forming intricate floral patterns. At the heart of the mausoleum lie the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, a quiet reminder of the love that inspired the creation of this masterpiece.

Visitors from around the world flock to the Taj Mahal, not only for its historical significance but also for its serene beauty. The well-maintained gardens, with the reflection of the monument in the central pool, offer a peaceful ambiance for tourists to take in the grandeur of this timeless monument. Visiting the Taj Mahal is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The sheer scale and beauty of this stunning monument took my breath away. The intricate marble work, the perfectly proportioned architecture, and the serene gardens all combined to create an unforgettable atmosphere.

As I walked through the complex, I was struck by the history and romance that surrounds this iconic wonder. The story of Shah Jahans love for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and the tragic circumstances that led to the Tajs construction, added a poignant depth to my visit.

The attention to detail in every aspect of the Tajs design is awe-inspiring. From the delicate calligraphy to the intricate inlays, every element seems to have been carefully considered to create a masterpiece. And yet, despite the opulence, the Taj exudes a sense of elegance and restraint.

As the sun began to set, the Taj transformed before my eyes, its white marble glowing with a soft golden light. It was as if the monument was radiating an otherworldly beauty, leaving me speechless and humbled.

The Taj Mahal is a must-visit for anyone seeking to experience the beauty and wonder of human creation. It is a testament to the power of love, art, and architecture to transcend time and touch our souls.

Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1631 and 1648, it was constructed in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. The Taj Mahal is a stunning example of Mughal architecture, blending elements of Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles.

The white marble mausoleum is known for its intricate inlay work of precious stones, symmetrical gardens, and reflecting pool, which enhances its beauty. The main dome, flanked by four minarets, is the most recognizable feature, symbolizing eternal love and devotion. The interior houses the cenotaphs of both Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, though their actual graves lie beneath the structure.

Over the centuries, the Taj Mahal has become a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage and a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors annually. Its ethereal beauty, especially at sunrise and sunset, captivates onlookers. Despite environmental concerns and the need for preservation, the Taj Mahal remains a timeless masterpiece and a testament to the enduring power of love.

It took more than 20,000 people to build and design it over 22 years. It is 100 meters wide and 60 meters high on each side. Approximately 42 acres, built with white marble and laterite. It is recommended to travel early in the morning. The sun will not be hot and the light will be beautiful, suitable for walking around and taking photos. And dont bring a lot of things with you because they need to be checked by officials. So you wont waste time.

Recommend being there relatively early in the day. Remember that it can get very hot on certain days, so remember to both eat and drink before going inside. When you get there, you buy a ticket, which can also be done online. There you can pay for a shuttle, type of large tuktuk for a few rupees, as it takes 5ish minutes to walk to the entrance from the car park. You will be given a bottle of water and socks for your shoes. You must use the socks to see inside the temple. If you have lost or forgotten them, you can also take off your shoes and put on your socks. It is not allowed to take pictures inside the temple, but everywhere else.

You will get offers from many for guided tours for from 500 to 2000 rupees, choose for yourself and carefully. You also get offers from photographers, I dont know if they are professional, and it costs from 1000 rupees.

There are also a good number of small shops on the outside, the prices are reasonable for the most part. Recommend shopping after youve been inside, as you cant take things with you into the Taj Mahal.

Also note that you cannot bring a computer, smoke, lighter, chewing gum, drops, food, drink or anything similar with you. You must either give this up or attach it to the guard. Recommends leaving everything, except the most necessary, in the car.

I also have to say a little about the toilets there. They are unmanned and dont seem like anyone is cleaning anything. There is a toilet there, both a toilet and a floor toilet. They looked absolutely terrible. People had peed and sprayed water all over the toilet, not a hygienic place. Preferably go to the bathroom before or after, as these barely work in an emergency. And, of course, no toilet paper for those who need it.

Husk at det kan bli veldig varmt visse dager, sa husk a bade spise og drikke for man gar inn. Nar man kommer dit sa kjoper man billett, kan ogsa gjores online. Der kan man betale for en shuttle, type stor tuktuk for noen rupi, da det tar 5 ish minutter a ga til inngangen fra parkeringsplassen. Du far utlevert en flaske med vann og sokker til skoene dine. Sokkene ma du bruke for a se inne i tempelet. Har du mistet eller glemt dem, sa kan du ogsa ta av deg sko og ga pa sokkene. Det er ikke lov a ta bilde inne i tempelet, men over alt pa resten.


Du far tilbud fra mangen om guidet tur for fra 500 til 2000 rupi, velg selv og med omhu. Man far ogsa tilbud fra fotograf, om de er profesjonelle vet jeg ikke, og det koster fra 1000 rupi.


Der er ogsa en god del sma butikker pa utsiden, prisene er fornuftige pa det meste. Anbefaler a handle etter du har vaert inne, da du ikke far ting med deg inn i Taj Mahal.


Vaer ogsa obs pa at du ikke kan ha med deg verken pc, royk, lighter, tyggegummi, drops, mat, drikke eller noe lignende. Dette ma du enten gi fra deg eller legge ved vakten. Anbefaler a la alt, utenom det mest nodvendige, bli i bilen.


Jeg ma ogsa si litt om toalettene der. De er ubemannet og virker ikke som noen rengjor noe som helst. Det er toalett der, bade klosett og gulv toalett. De sag absolutt heilt forferdelige ut. Folk hadde tisset og sprayet vann over hele toalettet, ikkje hygieniskt en plass. Gjerne ga pa do for eller etter, da disse sa vidt funker i noden. Og, saklart, ingen toalettpapir for dem som trenger det.",null

Words cannot do justice to its beauty and magnificence. The white marble structure is stunning, especially during sunrise and sunset when it takes on a warm glow. The intricate carvings, the symmetry, and the story behind its creation make it a must-visit. The gardens are beautifully maintained, adding to the serene atmosphere. Its a place that combines history, architecture, and romance in a way that leaves you in awe. Highly recommend visiting with a guide to fully appreciate the history and details. A visit to Agra isn't complete without experiencing the Taj Mahal.

The intricate carvings, the pristine white marble, and the sheer scale of the monument are simply awe-inspiring.
Its easy to see why the Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of love and devotion. The story behind its construction is incredibly touching.
While the crowds can be a bit overwhelming at times, its definitely worth dealing with to experience such a magnificent piece of architecture. I recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the biggest crowds.
Overall, the Taj Mahal is a must-see destination for anyone visiting India. Its a truly unforgettable experience that will stay with you for a lifetime.",2 days ago,2024-10-20T15:15:55,,,null,0,18,126,1,null,null

Advisable to get tickets online or from the QR scanner for payment available approximately 100m before the turnstile entry gate.

2. Best time is to visit early in the morning. Reach here at 6am and you will find less crowd and low temperature. There are few small shops inside providing water bottles and snacks.

3. For Indian tourists, seeing Taj Mahal from outside costs 50 INR and to get inside it costs 200 INR extra. So in total its 250/-. However there is a small discount for online tickets. You can get the above tickets in two parts of 50 and 200 from the counter or also directly 250. So if one takes only INR 50 ticket to just watch the Taj Mahal but later wishes to also get inside it, he can take 200/- ticket from the counter just outside the main Taj Mahal monument.

4. Inside the Taj Mahal you can go barefoot or with shoe cover. The reusable cloth shoe cover is available free of cost at the counter which is just outside the main Taj Mahal monument entrance. The shoe cover then needs to be deposited in the big containers at the exit.

5. Overall it will take 2-4 hours to complete the tour. The entry starts at approximately 5:30am in the morning till approximately 5 or 5:30 pm in the evening. However the selling of tickets both online and offline may stop early at around 5pm approximately. So at least by 4:30 pm one should reach the place.

6. The outermost entry gate is just at one minute walking distance from the Taj Mahal Metro Station. From this outermost entry gate, it will take 10-45min to reach the actual Taj Mahal by walking. All depending on the crowd and timing of the visit. It took us around 30 min overall including the time spent in the entry line, and also it was our first visit so that also adds to the time. Also we went on Saturday.

7. There are some 11-seater (approx) golf carts that are available just inside the outermost entrance gate for those who dont want to walk. They help you save only five to ten minutes of walking time. So we didnt opt for it.

8. Best time to reach is before 7am or after 4pm.

9. Its closed on Friday.

10. Taking photos is allowed almost everywhere with few exceptions.

11. Food items are not allowed to be carried inside. Water bottles are allowed. Checking of bags is properly done at the turnstile entry gate. However it may be possible to sneak in a toffee or two.

Do not take a guide until you trust.
Go to tajmahal by e-rickshaw and Dont take any food items and suspicious items they will remove it and throw it away.
It is better to take 250 Rs tickets in advance if you planned to visit inside taj. For 250 RS ticket line is very less for outside and inside as well.

As you approach the monument, its stunning white marble facade shines brilliantly against the blue sky, creating a breathtaking sight. The intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones tell a story of exquisite craftsmanship that leaves you in awe.

Inside, the serene atmosphere and the beautiful central dome add to the monuments allure. The surrounding gardens provide a peaceful setting for reflection and photography, making it a perfect spot to appreciate the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Visiting at sunrise or sunset is particularly magical, as the changing light casts a warm glow on the marble. Its important to arrive early to avoid the crowds and fully enjoy the experience.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument; its an unforgettable experience that captures the heart and imagination. A must-visit when in India!

The intricate marble work, the symmetrical gardens, and the reflection in the pool are mesmerizing.

However, be prepared for high humidity, especially if you're visiting during the warmer months. It can get quite uncomfortable, so I recommend carrying water, wearing light clothing, and taking breaks in the shaded areas.

Despite the weather, the beauty of this iconic monument makes it worth the visit..

This was our 2nd time visiting Taj Mahal . Right when you get to the entrance , you would think that you've seen it on TV numerous times and when you see it physically, it's another story . I'll spare you the history, everyone knows Moghul Emperor Shahjahan built this tomb after his wife Mumtaz Mahal died . Just imagine this was built during 1631-1658 manually located in Agra .

Guide is worth if you get a good one. Go before 11 am, as early as possible. It got very hot very quickly. In October. Apparently it's open on full moon nights, but not inside. Oh and tickets can be bought online, and there too with a scanner instead of standing in line.

Do not waste your money on the shops inside, they sell the same things on the street unless you want to invest in a piece of furniture or something big. Outside you can bargain. Overall a memorable experience. What an amazing mesmerising piece of history.

Built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this UNESCO World Heritage site is often regarded as the epitome of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles seamlessly.

The first sight of the Taj Mahal is breathtaking. Its pristine white marble facade glistens under the sun, reflecting in the pool that runs along the front gardens, creating a picture-perfect view.
The symmetry, intricate carvings, and inlay work of semi-precious stones make it a masterpiece of art and craftsmanship. The central dome, flanked by four smaller domes and four slender minarets, creates an awe-inspiring silhouette against the sky.
Inside the mausoleum, the artistry continues with delicate marble lattice screens and intricate pietra dura (stone inlay) work. The serene interior houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, surrounded by a peaceful ambiance that invites quiet reflection.
The surrounding gardens, known as the Charbagh, are beautifully landscaped and provide a serene setting to enjoy the beauty of the monument from different angles.

The Yamuna River flowing behind the Taj Mahal adds to its tranquility, especially at sunrise and sunset when the monument takes on different hues, from soft pink to golden and pearly white.The experience of visiting the Taj Mahal is further enriched by knowledgeable guides who provide insights into its history, architecture, and the poignant love story behind its creation. Despite the crowds, the monuments beauty and historical significance make it worth the visit.
Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument but an experience that leaves visitors spellbound by its beauty, historical significance, and the timeless love story it represents. A visit to India would be incomplete without witnessing this wonder of the world.

You may face some difficulty in reaching Taj Mahal. Like traffic, route divert and parking. Car parking goes up to 20/hr.
To book tickets, I would say that you should book online only so that you will avoid standing in the queue. I would like to tell you one more thing in this, the normal ticket is 40-30, in which you can only go around the Taj Mahal but not inside the Taj Mahal. For this you will have to pay 200 extra and children up to 15 years of age are free to take them anywhere in Taj Mahal. Means no ticket. If you want to go to Taj Mahal, you will get shoe covers for which you do not have to pay anything extra. If you do not want to go to the Taj Mahal and just want to roam around the Taj Mahal, then you do not have to cover your shoes.

Visiting the Taj Mahal was an unforgettable experience. This iconic monument lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places in the world. Here are my thoughts:

1. Architectural Beauty:
The Taj Mahal's architecture is simply breathtaking. The white marble seems to glow, especially at sunrise and sunset. The intricate carvings and the perfect symmetry make it feel like a work of art. The dome and the four surrounding minarets are an impressive sight up close.

2. Emotional Connection:
Knowing the history behind the Taj Mahal, built as a symbol of love by Emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, added a deeply emotional layer to my visit. It feels more than just a building--it's a tribute to eternal love and devotion, which made the experience even more meaningful.

3. Serene Surroundings:
The gardens and the reflection pool surrounding the monument create a peaceful atmosphere. Despite the crowds, I found moments of quiet where I could simply appreciate the beauty and calmness of the environment.

4. Crowds and Experience:
The Taj Mahal can get quite crowded, especially during peak times. However, even with the number of people, the beauty of the place shines through. I would recommend visiting early in the morning to avoid large crowds and enjoy a more peaceful experience.

5. Overall Impressions:
Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or simply want to witness one of the wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It's a timeless monument that captivates you from the moment you step inside the gates. I left feeling inspired and moved by both its beauty and the story behind it.",a week ago,2024-10-15T15:16:30,,,null,0,12,2,1,null,null

Johirul Islam,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103324125521366961130/reviews?entry=ttu,5,"The Taj Mahal, a symbol of eternal love, takes on a magical glow in the early morning hours that is truly indescribable. As the first rays of the sun gently kiss the pristine white marble, the entire monument seems to radiate with a soft, golden light. This moment, fleeting and delicate, gives the Taj an ethereal beauty, as if its floating in a dreamlike world. The cool morning air adds to the serenity, allowing visitors to absorb the grandeur of this architectural masterpiece in peace and reflection.

The symmetry of the Taj Mahal, with its majestic domes and minarets, stands in stark contrast to the quiet of the early hours. There's a stillness, broken only by the songs of birds and the soft murmur of the Yamuna River in the distance. The marble's intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones sparkle subtly, enhanced by the soft sunlight, and every detail comes alive under this natural glow.

Seeing the Taj Mahal at dawn is more than just a visual experience; it's deeply emotional. The monument, built as a testament to Shah Jahan's undying love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, evokes feelings of timelessness, loss, and beauty. As the sun continues to rise, the colors of the sky shift from pale blues to warm oranges, wrapping the Taj in a soft embrace that seems almost heavenly.

To truly understand the allure of the Taj Mahal, one must experience this sacred moment. It's not just a wonder of architecture but a place where nature and artistry come together, leaving you with a sense of awe and peace that lingers long after the sun has fully risen.

But if photographers are coming to you and asking to do your photoshoot, please dont. The quality of pictures is really low, not professional, boring/cheesy poses.
Your phone is probably taking wayyy better pictures. If you count on the photographer to take your pictures, you might end up without any nice pictures. The Taj isnt even clear in our photos.
Also, very crowded, better come early.

You HAVE to BE there at 05:00 a.m. (gates open at 05:45 a.m.) if you want to have gorgeous views and pics but most importantly, if you want to explore the place calmly without crowds. It's well organized. Buy the tickets online before hand, and you will be ok. Beware of all the ""photographers"" and tour guides trying to sell you their services. Beware also that the museum that comes with the ticket price, only open at 09:00 so if you are there at 05:00 it will be a long wait (and you cannot get in food or beverages other than water).

I left the hotel at 5:30 in the morning and arrived at the Taj Mahal quickly. There will be fewer people entering from the other side door, so you can enter earlier. At sunrise, the white marble will have different reflections of light, because there is a tour guide who knows what special photos to take at which points. It takes about two hours to take pictures and browse. You need to go through security before entering, and you cant bring a lot of things. Remember to ask the tour guide. Food or other electronic items are not allowed to be brought in. The ticket is 1,300 rupees. I asked the travel agency to buy it for me first. He sent a file with a QR Code in it.

We had visited after quite a few years!
The first glimpse of the Taj is at the entrance of the Main Gate and its enchanting!
The whole area around it is very well maintained.
The guide took us around in a very systematic way, explained quite a few things about the beautiful.historical monument!
The beauty and symmetry of the monument takes ones breath away!
Its indeed an architectural wonder!
It was heartening to see Good toilet and drinking water facilities.
We felt the guide fees of rupees thousand to be a bit exorbitant.
The guides need to update their knowledge of the history and architecture of the monument.

Even in one corner you can see the air quality of Agra which is nice.
The government is taking good care of the Taj Mahal which was required. You need to take at least one id proof of yours for entering the Taj Mahal. The gardens are fully beautified with nice plants.
Should go atleast once in todays government take care service.

When I saw the dome of the Taj Mahal from outside before entering the main gate, it was a once-in-a-lifetime moment that was truly unforgettable. Words cannot express the beauty of that sight.

It is surreal when you enter from the main gate and see the Taj Mahal receding from your sight, The view was truly magnificent. Once inside, I sat on the floor and gazed at the Taj Mahal for over an hour without moving.

However, the place was overcrowded with many .People were striking funny poses for photographers. One funny example is trying to imitate the famous pose of raising one hand and touching the tip of the Taj Mahal .

Despite this, the Taj Mahal offers a variety of experiences - from a sense of peace when ignoring the chaos around you, to moments of joy when observing the surroundings, and even situations that could potentially make you angry. It is a place where you can never feel bored.

Although I am not sharing my experience with scammers around the Taj Mahal because everyone might be aware of that issue.

This place needs no narration. Many authors like Ravindra nath Tagore has said about it.
This monument built by Moghal king Shajahan on the banks of river Yamuna with marble stones procured from Rajasthan is perhaps the most advertised place of India. From the local guide it was learnt that architects from Iran n Turkey were engaged for construction of this structure, which contains the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the queen and Shahjahn.",a week ago,2024-10-15T15:16:55,,,null,0,22,6,1,null,null

Its just mesmerizing. Though people around arent that polite and helpful. First of all, the taxi drivers, they said there is no place near the monument to keep your luggage, so you have to keep your luggage with us and pay extra. When we reached there was free cloakroom near the monument.

Things didnt end here. Inside the monument a so called photographer said he is certified, clicked random photos and charged us 20 per photo and trust me not a single photo was worth it. We had clicked far better photos in our phones. He charged us around 700 for some unwanted photos.

I would like to say one thing, what do you people gain by cheating tourists around the world for a mere 100 rupees. You would earn a little extra but spoil the travelers whole mood and excitement.

Just felt disgusted.

Review:

The Taj Mahal is a breathtaking testament to the power of love and human ingenuity. Its intricate marble facade, adorned with delicate floral carvings and calligraphy, is a sight to behold. The symmetrical design and the play of light and shadow create a mesmerizing atmosphere.
While the crowds can be significant, especially during peak tourist seasons, the experience is still unforgettable. The early morning hours offer a more serene and less crowded visit, allowing you to truly appreciate the monuments beauty.
A guided tour can provide valuable insights into the history and architecture of the Taj Mahal. Dont miss the opportunity to explore the surrounding gardens, which are equally stunning and offer a peaceful respite from the bustling city.

Tips for visitors:
* Plan your visit: Consider visiting during the off-peak seasons (November to February or July to August) to avoid large crowds.
* Dress appropriately: Modest clothing is required, and avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless tops.
* Carry necessary items: Bring sunscreen, water, and comfortable shoes.
* Respect the monument: Adhere to the rules and regulations, and refrain from touching the marble surfaces.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is a must-see destination for anyone visiting India. Its timeless beauty and historical significance make it a truly unforgettable experience.

The beauty of this monument is breathtaking, and it looks even more stunning in person. The symmetry, marble work, and overall elegance make it clear why it's one of the wonders of the world. We took many photos, and even hired a DSLR photographer to capture the essence of this beautiful place - each picture is a treasure!

The ambiance is peaceful, and watching the Taj at different times of the day offers a unique charm every time. A must-visit for anyone in search of architectural marvels and timeless beauty!

The intricate marble carvings, the symmetry, and the serenity of the gardens around it create a peaceful atmosphere.
The well-maintained grounds and the informative guides added to the experience.
A must-visit for anyone traveling to India.

Yes, the building is impressive, but the overall organisation, infrastructure around do now enable one to feel the place. Yes, the government tries to put some measures to prevent the landmark from dust and mud by banning the gasoline transport around or by fighting the plastic, but still - one should squeeze through crowded dirty streets, rusty gates, not talking about the city nearby. Even the history of the building is, for me, quite far from creating a positive mood. The poor girl was giving birth to another child every 1.5 years during her best years, for the 18th time she died and only after that her husband finally decided to build a home for her, and this construction bankrupted the country. I would not recommend coming specially just for a one-day tour from Delhi. Only if you decide to stay somewhere nearby on the way to another place - then you will probably come by early morning, and will have other feelings than me.

Do hire a guide..
Bcz just a walk around this big monument is not that exciting...
I insist on hiring a guide
P.S do not pay more than 1000 Rs even if you are a group.

Bonus : hiring a guide will save you from long queues and the ticketing process.
But its advisable only if you are a large group.

Your best bet is to go at sunrise when there are few tourists and you will have ample time to walk all over the grounds and take photos. I went there around 8:30 AM in early October, and it was already crowded.
Enter from the east gate. Thats where most of the hotels, restaurants, shops and guides are.
Do get a registered tour guide, but only outside the ticket counter, not from anywhere else. You can negotiate with them.
If you want to get professional photos inside, each hard copy would cost you INR 100, while each soft copy would cost you INR 80. However, the number of pictures you get taken could easily reach 100, so keep that in mind.
Get the ticket for the mausoleum as well, the design inside is stunning.

A major restoration was carried out at the beginning of the 20th century under the direction of Lord Curzon, then the British viceroy of India. More recently, air pollution caused by emissions from foundries and other nearby factories and exhaust from motor vehicles has damaged the mausoleum, notably its marble facade. A number of measures have been taken to reduce the threat to the monument, among them the closing of some foundries and the installation of pollution-control equipment at others, the creation of a parkland buffer zone around the complex, and the banning of nearby vehicular traffic. A restoration and research program for the Taj Mahal was initiated in 1998. Progress in improving environmental conditions around the monument has been slow, however.

From time to time the Taj Mahal has been subject to India's political dynamics. Night viewing was banned there between 1984 and 2004 because it was feared that the monument would be a target of Sikh militants. In addition, it increasingly has come to be seen as an Indian cultural symbol. Some Hindu nationalist groups have attempted to diminish the importance of the Muslim influence in accounting for the origins and design of the Taj Mahal.",2 weeks ago,2024-10-08T15:17:13,,,null,0,102,144,1,null,null

Entry time:- 30 minutes before Sunrise to 30 minutes before sunset.
Entry from East and West gate only.
Clock room available but they will charge 30 rs for big bags, small bags are free of cost.
The ticket price is 50 for Taj mahal and additional 200 for the main mausoleum you will get a 5 rs discount on the online ticket.
Try do visit in the forenoon. Too much heat so do carry a hat and water bottle with you, water tap is available inside.
The shopkeeper outside will ask you to buy shoe covers but dont buy it because it is available in the Taj mahal for free.
Tip:- You will not get any sharing auto for Taj mahal or any other monuments in agra so if you are solo then book rapido bike taxi which is cheaper than the reserved autos.

I visited the Taj Mahal between 10 AM and 12 PM. While the monument itself is breathtaking, I realized this might not be the best time to visit. Early mornings or evenings are probably more pleasant as it was quite sunny during my visit.
A quick note on the tickets: there are two options - 50 and 250. The 250 ticket includes access to the mausoleum, but personally, I didn't find it worth the extra cost. Overall, a must-visit, but plan your timing and ticket choice accordingly!

The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million) VB The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.

, I told my friends that we should first ride on the R-cart of the tourist department, but we were trapped in the sweet language of the e-rickshaw drivers. That e-rickshaw driver took us from the West Gate back to the Main Road and then through the narrow streets and dropped us at the East Gate. During this entire journey, mine and my friends knees collided with other e-rickshaws many times. Had they collided, we would have had to spend a few days in the hospital and it is not known how long we would be able to walk properly.
My request to everyone is that the best way to go to Taj Mahal is from the West Gate and to go inside from the parking here, use the e-cart of the tourist department which has about 12 seats. And whenever you travel anywhere by e-rickshaw etc., do not take your feet out of the e-rickshaw at all. Otherwise any serious accident can happen to you. And if you go by purchasing the ticket online, it will be even better, you will not have to stand in line for the ticket.

Park your vehicle in the government authorised parking and take a golf buggy which charges Rs. 20 from parking to the main entrance gate. Get the tickets either from agents by paying Rs 20-25 per ticket extra or you can get the tickets on your own by booking online through the Taj Mahal online booking portal and that is a very easy process. You have two options to buy tickets either for Rs. 50 or Rs. 245. For Rs 50 you will get entry to the Taj Mahal area but I will recommend you to buy the ticket for Rs 245 which will give you access to enter the Taj Mahal and there you can see the burial of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan and the actual view of Taj Mahal premises.

The monument is well maintained, no pictography allowed inside the Taj Mahal. You have to wear shoe cover, either purchase it before hand or it is also available in the premises. Tickets are worth 50 INR for Indian citizens to enter the premises and 250 for access to the Taj Mahal. There is a generally a wait of up to 30 minutes. Earlier the better! You can buy tickets inside, not so crowded, I would not ask you to buy tickets beforehand but definitely would recommend an early morning visit. The sunrise behind the Taj is just mesmerizing!

However, the ticket price for entering the mausoleum is QR 200, which I found a bit high. One thing to note is that you'll need shoe covers or you'll have to carry your shoes in hand, as they don't sell covers inside, so it's best to bring them from outside. There's also a Taj Museum worth visiting, but be aware that its hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, which differs from the Taj Mahal's visiting hours.

He was trying to build a grave of the same shape as his wifes, whom he loved enough to build such a wonderful grave, on the opposite bank in black marble, but that wish did not come true (;;)

Unparalleled beauty, registered as a World Heritage Site
It is said that Shahjahan built it as a symbol of his eternal love for his beloved wife.
Registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
A masterpiece of Indian architecture that combines Mughal culture and Islamic art!

I dont think anyone goes to India and leaves without seeing this place.
You should go!
Baggage checks are strict, so bags larger than A4 size are prohibited, and battery-related items are also prohibited. Shoe covers and a bottle of water are available with the ticket purchase.
There is an additional fee to enter the Taj Mahal.

Well managed. I happened to go on a less crowded day. Easy to navigate. And there are people who will help you take lovely pics of yourself on your own phone. They charge 150-200 rupees. The atmosphere is serene. Watching the Yamuna from behind the Taj Mahal is a wonderful experience. Must visit for everyone.

This is caused by air pollution, insect droppings and construction work in the area.

The water quality of the nearby Yamuna River is severely polluted, leading to a massive infestation of insects, which in turn contaminate the buildings.

The low water level of the Yamuna River has caused the foundations of the Taj Mahal to dry out and become brittle.

It is a mausoleum but truly extraordinary. There is no paint, everything is white marble with inlaid stones which give shine.

Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan built this magnificent monument in memory of his wife Arjumand Banu Begum, also known as Mumtaz Mahal. The construction of the monument started in 1632 AD and was completed around 1653 AD.
The Taj Mahal (sometimes simply called the Taj) is considered a striking example of Mughal architecture, combining Persian, Turkish, Indian and Islamic architecture. Although the white marble domed royal mausoleum is the most admired, the Taj Mahal is actually a complex monolithic structure as a whole. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. The Taj Mahal is one of the Seventh Wonders of the World. It was then called the Universally Acclaimed Masterpiece of World Heritage.",3 weeks ago,2024-10-01T15:17:51,,,null,0,407,165,1,"taajmhl (hindi: taaj mhl, urdu: tj mHl) bhaarter uttr prdeshe aagraay' absthit ektti raajkiiy' smaadhi /  mughl smraatt shaahjaahaan taar strii aarjumaand baanu begm yini mumtaaj mhl naame pricit, taar smRtir uddeshe ei apuurb saudhtti nirmaann kren /  saudhttir nirmaann shuru hy'echil 1632 khrissttaabde yaa smpuurnn hy'echil praay' 1653 khrissttaabde /

If youre reading this, you will obviously go there. So try to go in peak winters, otherwise its hell due to the heat (along with other issues).

Get your tickets online beforehand as its easier. No timing issue. It has multiple gates. The metro station gate is packed with crowds so take an e rickshaw and take the south gate. Official guides are 1800 bucks so people take cheaper ones.

You cant take much stuff inside so get it submitted outside and take a token. The entry queue is the worst hell ever. First you get yourself checked, then put your bag on the belt. Then they put your bags on a table where other hundreds of bags are kept and then starts a big crowd fight to get it checked by security by hand. They will embarrassingly open up ladies/gents bags and purses and check everything one by one. You can imagine how much time one by one bag checking would take! People are screaming and shouting in crowds and fighting to get their bags checked quickly.

There are no canopies or shades. In heat you will burn yourself while walking. The monument is majestic no doubt but only go there in winters. Guides and photographers will make matters worse. They will irritate you.

If you are planning to visit the mausoleum, then skip it if youre not a history buff. The cost of ticket is extra. You cant take pictures inside it. Its not that big. And you have to wait in line to get shoe covers and pay 10 bucks each for it.

Overall its a money making monument with torturous management. If nothing else, at least put some shades around the walking path. Im sure the photographers and guides that are inside are paying hefty bribes to the management otherwise how come they can make their business without paying for tickets etc.

Only go on the weekends (its closed on Fridays). And only go in winters, if you have to!

The gardens are peaceful, and the view at sunrise is unforgettable. However, it can get quite crowded, so plan your visit early for a more serene experience. A must-see when in India!

Tomorrow at 5:50 a.m. no queue for tickets, be sure to book the mausoleum (200 rupees more, total 1300 rupees for foreigners) so that you can get to the upper platform in front of the Taj. You get a bottle of water and shoe covers at a second counter. Other drinks and food would not be taken. Entry at the West Gate takes less than a minute at 6 a.m. From 7 a.m. it became noticeably more crowded. Great, spacious facility - no more harassment from salespeople inside. You can find all the paths on your own, the tour is self-explanatory. With lots of pictures, 1.5 hours is sufficient.

I have been there 4 times and you never get bored from it. But choose to go in winters as you have to walk a lot.

Be careful about the guide mafia in Agra. Nevertheless, it preferred to take a guide for sure as it becomes easy for you to get the tickets, enter Taj and he can guide you on history as well.

Early for the sunrise. No queues as such.
Electric vehicles from the drop off point to the entry point. Buy tickets and then through security screening. Double check the list of things you cannot bring in.
As a group, we got a photographer who took all of our group photos. Cost is IDR$100 per photo or in bulk deal and you get paper photo and electronic copy as well.
Both the long distance wide angle photo and from the Diana seat. Well worth it.
We chose to go barefoot on the marble instead of wearing the shoe covers. It felt so good to be walking on such hallowed grounds in bare feet.
Awesome and truly amazing place.
Highly recommend to everyone.
Note : There are hawkers inside the grounds who will help with photos or provide artistic guidance for a tip.
Nice to walk around the whole grounds and enjoy the experience.
It gets much busier after sunrise, and is busy all day.

Unfortunately is primarily an outdoor only visit for photo ops, but beautiful grounds. Not too crowded in early september, but helpful with my Teavelogy guide Mr Tanveer in history and photos. I bought into one of the main hustling, paid photographer onsite who did deliver great shots. Negotiated 30 prints in an album with all 78 ephoto files (downloaded to my whatsapp) delivered on exit @3000 rupees. My guide ensured that I got everything before I paid. Overkill, but worth it.
Be sure to limit carrying any foods, gum, candies, hazardous items as its prohibited (littering) and security scanning is strict.

As soon as we got to the Taj Mahal, we were approached by a guide who instantly took us to book online tickets and used his phone number to get the online tickets. I advised home we dont need a guide and just want to enjoy the Taj Mahal by ourselves but we were constantly pressured. He then took us to the golf carts, who drive for like 10 meters then stopped and asked us all to pay, then when we got to the security check area they took our bags away from us and told us to go back to the male section and go through the body scanner. Then the police made remarks that other police in hindi that because we were foreigners we should be checked more thoroughly, i asked why as were from Australia and our security is more strict, then they put all my things back in my bags and let us go through. At the first point the guide spoke for about 5 minutes, I stopped him and said we dont need a guide and that he needs to stop pressuring us. I gave him 500 rupees and told him to leave us alone and he started hassling us and said we should have told him right at the beginning, I told I tried to tell you at the beginning but you did not want to listen. After he left us alone, we enjoyed a nice 1 hour walk admiring the majestic Taj Mahal and the surrounding grounds. We also paid the extra 200rupees to go inside the mausoleum but when you get to the entrance then to get the blue shoe cover its 50rupees each.

It is a shame that India has such fascinating monuments, culture and history but it all gets ruined by scammers. The government should get involved and make all these places a better place without allowing scammers to stay active.

Pro:
April/May is summer, so there weren't too many people!  We could soak in the beauty without the usual massive crowds

Con:
It's HOT. Like, seriously HOT!  Be ready for the sun and heat, especially if you're there later in the day. Bring a hat or sunscreen 

We got our tickets on the spot --1,100 rupees for Southeast Asian tourists like us  It includes a super helpful tour guide & bottled water 

We got there bright and early at 5 AM to catch the sunrise & it was magical! 

Since it was so early, the place was practically less crowded. As the day went on, it did get busier, so the early bird definitely gets the best views 

Our tour guide gave us all the details about the Taj Mahal's history --from how it was built to all the little stories that made it so special

Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is a whole other level. It's so much bigger and more beautiful than we ever imagined . The surrounding gardens are gorgeous too --perfect for taking a little break in the shade

Afterward, our guide took us to a souvenir shop . It was a bit pricey , and they claimed the items were made with stones used in the Taj Mahal itself. We couldn't resist and bought something, but by the time we got back to home, it had cracked 

Overall, it was such an unforgettable experience

Please, leave lighters and tobacco in the cloakroom which will make you come back: scrupulous checks by the military at the entrance! It is also worth buying the ticket to enter the mausoleum (it is not possible to take photos inside and you enter barefoot or with shoe covers). The visit can be done calmly in two hours.

The park surrounding the Taj is beautifully maintained, with vibrant gardens, walking paths, and a tranquil atmosphere. I was impressed by the history and romance surrounding this wonder of the world. The reflecting pools, fountains, and scenic views of the Yamuna River add to the magic. The park is perfect for a leisurely stroll or a picnic. The facilities are well-maintained, and the staff is helpful. A must-visit attraction in India, especially at sunrise or sunset when the Taj shimmers like a diamond.

As one of the Seven Wonders of the World, it truly lives up to its reputation. The beauty and serenity of the Taj Mahal are unparalleled--its a sight to behold and a peaceful retreat.

The security is tight, which is reassuring given the number of visitors. The complex is well-maintained, though it can get crowded, especially with photographers trying to capture the perfect shot. It costs 30 for a single photo, and you might end up spending quite a bit if you want multiple shots.

Entry to the Taj Mahal costs 50, and if you want to visit the tomb inside, theres an additional charge of 250. Despite these costs, the experience is well worth it. The majesty of the monument and the historical significance make it a must-visit for anyone traveling to India. Highly recommended for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply appreciating an iconic piece of heritage!

From the moment I arrived, I was struck by t sheer beauty and grandeur of this iconic monument.

The Taj Mahal's pristine white marble facade, adorned with intricate inlay work, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The symmetry and craftsmanship are exquisite, reflecting the incredible artistry and dedication of its creators. The surrounding gardens, reflecting pools, and the serene Yamuna River add to the monument's allure, providing a picturesque backdrop that enhances the overall experience.

Walking through the mausoleum and gazing at the detailed marble inlays and carvings was a profound experience. The interior, where Emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal are entombed, is as beautiful and serene as the exterior.

The best time to visit is early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the light creates a stunning play of colors on the marble, adding to the monument's ethereal quality. The staff and guides are knowledgeable and enhance the visit with rich historical context and insights.

Overall, a visit to the Taj Mahal is a must for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply experiencing one of the worlds most beautiful places. It's a remarkable testament to love and an unforgettable journey into India's rich cultural heritage.

Recognized globally for its stunning beauty, this UNESCO World Heritage Site was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

The Taj Mahal's architectural grandeur is breathtaking. Its white marble facade, adorned with intricate inlays and detailed carvings, exudes a timeless elegance. The central dome, surrounded by lush gardens, reflecting pools, and four minarets, creates a harmonious and majestic visual impression. The symmetry and meticulous design exemplify Mughal architectural brilliance and craftsmanship.

Visitors to the Taj Mahal are often captivated by its serene atmosphere and the emotional depth of its backstory. Early mornings and late afternoons are particularly recommended for viewing, as the play of light enhances the marble's shimmering quality and the surrounding landscape's beauty.

However, the site does face some challenges. It can become extremely crowded, particularly during peak tourist seasons, which might detract from the experience. Additionally, the surrounding area has seen increasing commercial development, which some visitors find less appealing. Efforts to manage crowds and maintain the site's pristine condition are ongoing, but improvements in visitor management could enhance the overall experience.

In summary, the Taj Mahal remains a monumental testament to love and architectural excellence. Despite some challenges related to crowd management and commercialization, its enduring beauty and historical significance make it a must-visit landmark for anyone traveling to India.",a month ago,2024-09-22T15:18:59,,,null,0,152,70,1,null,null

Telling me that the waiting time to go in might take 45 - 60 mins.
If I use him, no waiting time and everything will be express. He quoted me 1800 rupee and it was raining at that time. Wanted to use him but in the end , he bought me to a parking place that need to pay 100 rupee and after that I decided not to because before he told me that parking is free.

After that , I managed to park at the area where the electric bungee were and paid 20 rupee for the bungee to get in to the ticket counter. Upon arriving at the parking , there are a lot more guides knocking at my door.
Some charges 200 rupee to get tickets for me.
Some asking for 500 rupee as a guide. But I had rejected all and took the bungee in.
There was no Q at all at the counter and the process was fast.
A lot of people there trying to be nice to help me guide the way , sell umbrella , rent , or even pass me the umbrella but after that wanted me to go to their shops.
But I had rejected all and decided to just walk in the rain.
Process for checking the bags and body checks was chaotic. No food allowed , I had sweets in my bag and was asked to throw. I had a talisman that I bought at leh which was forbidden to bring in and I threw it away during the check too.
After that , it's the walk and the majestic view.
Its was raining and windy.
And I think that there would be more people if there was no rain.
When everything is finish , going back out , I got to face the shops owners asking me to go in their shops and the waiting for the bungee ride are in a mess.
But somehow I managed to get up 1 and this time I didn't pay anything. I don't know why.
But I am grateful that I am able to witness everything and was safe.
Hope I can help people who want to come here to understand more of how the process is like.
And the ticket is 1300 rupee including the walk in the museum. I advise to get them too rather then just paying 1100 rupee to go in.

You cant understand until you see it in real life...

Little advice:
Avoid going there on weekends, its crowded and the queue to get in is huge (and no one respects it. You get jostled as if you were in the middle of a herd of buffalo.)

It is a masterpiece which is difficult to re-create with the same intricacies and finesse.
Not only the Taj Mahal, but the entire area is well maintained with greenery all around and cleanliness is also fully maintained.
When we visited, all the water bodies were without water as there was some cleaning project happening, but still it did not impact the beauty of the giant marble structure.
It is recommended to visit in the first half of the day or early mornings are much better to avoid unwanted crowds and to appreciate the real magnificence.
If one wants to go inside the massive building, there are separate tickets of 200 and 250 and need to buy disposable shoe covers from the counter or lot of hawkers selling it outside for 10 for each pair. Though reusable ones are available too, but they are filthy and smelling. Entry tickets are for 40 each and children can visit for free.
If you get a chance to visit, do not miss the opportunity and show it to the younger generation too.

It is situated in Agra City on the bank of the Yamuna river, Uttar Pradesh. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal Emperor. The height of Taj Mahal is 73 m. It is a very beautiful and wonderful view. Lots of foreigners are coming to India to see this beautiful place. I love this place as it is very huge and the construction of the Taj Mahal is very awesome. This is built by Shahajahan for Mumtaz Mahal, his wife. According to a survey it is seen that there are wooden constructions below Taj Mahal because this is situated near the river and due to water this special wood becomes strong. It is a famous spot in the Agra and even in India. This is a very busy tourist place. During the India-Pakistan war this place is covered with bamboo and Cloth to avoid Air strike. A yearly nearly 4.5 million visitors are coming to this place.

The Taj Mahal is a symphony of marble and moonlight, a harmony of human emotion and divine beauty. As I stood before its shimmering facade, I felt the weight of love and loss, the tender touch of a emperors devotion to his beloved. The intricate inlays danced like stars in the fading light, and the reflecting pools rippled like the tears of the bereaved. In this mausoleum of wonder, I discovered the transcendent power of art to capture the essence of the human experience. The Taj Mahal is more than a monument - its a whispered promise of eternal love, echoing across the centuries.",a month ago,2024-09-22T15:19:03,,,null,6,175,226,1,null,null

The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited. The stunning white marble structure, intricate carvings, and the serene gardens make it a sight to behold. Visiting early in the morning allowed me to witness the sunrise, which gave the monument a magical glow. The architecture and history behind this monument are incredible, and the experience of seeing it in person is unmatched. A must-visit if youre in India!

The principal architect and builder was Ustad Ahmed Lahauri, an exemplary Mughal architect who managed the carving and construction structure of the Taj Mahal. He created the unique architectural style of the Taj Mahal and incorporated Mughal culture and architecture as well as traditional Indian styles. Additionally, other artisans were also involved in this work, who were his distinguished assistants and helped in various aspects of the construction. This included a team of residential and non-residential artisans, marble cutting artisans, marble artisans, colorful stitching artisans, carving artisans, lighting artists and jewelers. They worked on marble and stone carving, luminous art, tunneling architecture, silver work, colorful stitching and gold work. The beauty, carvings and intricate craftsmanship of the Taj Mahal symbolize the hard work and skill of the artisans who built this great grandeur.

The full name of Taj Mahal is ""Diwan-i-Khas-i-Khusro"". This mausoleum was built in memory of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Mughal emperor Shahjahan. It is also known as ""Taj Mahal"" in English. ""Taj"" means ""Taj Mahal"" and ""Mahal"" means ""mausoleum"" or ""palace"". It means ""Taj mausoleum"" or ""Taj palace"". It is one of the major heritage sites of India and is considered as the most amazing architectural decoration of the world.

Visiting the Taj Mahal was an awe-inspiring experience! The monuments beauty is beyond words, with its shimmering white marble glowing under the sunlight and the intricately detailed carvings leaving me speechless. It's truly a masterpiece of architecture and a symbol of eternal love.

I recommend arriving early to avoid crowds and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the reflection of the Taj in the water is absolutely magical.

It was built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of love and is one of the seven wonders of the world. Its construction began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, taking approximately 22 years to build.

The Taj Mahal is constructed from white marble and its architecture is a beautiful fusion of Mughal, Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. Apart from the main dome, it also has four minarets which further enhance its beauty. The tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shahjahan are located inside the Taj Mahal.

Its walls have exquisite carvings and decoration of precious stones, which makes it unique. The beauty of the Taj Mahal situated on the banks of Yamuna river becomes even more captivating when its reflection is seen in the water. Every year lakhs of tourists come from India and abroad to see it. Taj Mahal is not only a heritage of India, but it is also a unique example of art, culture and love.

Architecture
The Taj Mahal is an example of Mughal architecture, which combines Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.

World Heritage Site
The Taj Mahal complex was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

Guides are kind of fraudsters there they are having chain system, they can go in the premises of Taj will tell you little bit and then book a specific fraud cameraman and then will let you go in a shops where the items are not the worthy but asking for an extra charge and then they will let you go in a specific shop like prachin which is not the good one and they are having all stuff linked and on commissioned basis..it is good to read the books and watch YouTube videos and enjoy the Natural beauty.

Be aware during booking of these fraudsters

The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time.
The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.",a month ago,2024-09-22T15:19:48,,,null,0,634,3848,1,null,null

This exquisite white marble mausoleum, commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, stands as a testament to the grandeur of Mughal architecture and the enduring love between Shah Jahan and his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

**Architecture:**
The Taj Mahals design is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles. Its centerpiece is the stunning white marble dome, which is surrounded by four minarets. The mausoleum is set within a sprawling garden, featuring symmetrical layouts, reflecting pools, and lush greenery, enhancing its serene beauty.

**Significance:**
The Taj Mahal was built as a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahans beloved wife who passed away during childbirth. The structure not only serves as a tribute to her but also represents the zenith of Mughal architecture. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for its cultural and architectural significance.

**Visiting Tips:**
- **Best Time to Visit:** Early morning or late afternoon, especially during sunrise or sunset, for the best light and fewer crowds.
- **Tickets:** Purchase tickets in advance online to avoid long queues. There are separate tickets for Indian citizens and international tourists.
- **Dress Code:** Modest clothing is recommended.
- **Photography:** Photography is allowed in designated areas, but tripods and professional cameras may require special permits.
- **Guides:** Hiring a local guide can enrich your visit with historical insights and anecdotes.

The Taj Mahal is not just a monument but a timeless symbol of love and architectural brilliance. Its breathtaking beauty continues to captivate visitors from around the globe, making it a must-see destination for anyone traveling to India.",a month ago,2024-09-22T15:19:53,,,null,0,55,573,1,null,null

It was built in the 17th century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.[1]

Duration: 10 minutes and 7 seconds.10:07
Taj Mahal incomparable heritage
Mughal architecture was at its peak during the time of Mughal emperor Shahjahan, Taj Mahal is the most famous example of that architecture. Taj Mahal is an excellent example of Mughal architecture. Its architectural style is a unique fusion of elements from Persian, Ottoman, Indian and Islamic architecture. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with this, it was described as one of the most universally praised human creations of world heritage. Taj Mahal has also been declared the gem of Islamic art of India. Unlike the commonly seen buildings which are covered with large sheets of marble blocks, its white dome and tiles are covered [2] with marble in shape. The tomb built in the center shows the combination of beauty in its architectural superiority. The special thing about the structure of the Taj Mahal building group is that it is completely symmetrical. Its construction was completed around 1648. [1] Ustad Ahmed Lahauri is often considered its chief designer. [3] It took about 22 years to construct the Taj Mahal.

mausoleum

Map of floor plan of Taj Mahal
The centerpiece of the Taj Mahal is the white marble mausoleum built on a square foundation. It is a symmetrical building, which has an iwan i.e. a very large curved (arch-shaped) door. A large dome adorns the top of this building. Like most Mughal tombs, its basic components are of Persian origin.

basic premise
Its basic foundation is a huge multi-chambered structure. This main chamber is cubic, each side of which is 55 meters (see: floor map, right). On the long sides is a massive pishtaq, or arched-roofed chamber gate. It is connected to the arched balcony above.

main arch
On either side of the main arch, two additional pishtaqs are built on either side, one above the other. In the same style, two pishtaqs (one above the other) are built on all four sides of the chamber. This structure is completely symmetrical on each side of the building, which makes the building an octagon rather than a square, but since the four corner sides are much shorter than the other four sides, it would be appropriate to call it square. The four towers around the tomb seem to frame the view of the building, at the four corners of the original base post. The main chamber contains the fake tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shahjahan. These are very decorated, and their original is situated on the lower floor.

As you approach this iconic monument, the anticipation builds, and the moment you catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels as though youve stepped into a dream. The Taj Mahals ethereal beauty defies words; its sheer size, the intricate details of the carvings, and the symmetry of the entire structure make it a sight to behold.

Upon arrival, you are greeted by helpful local guides, who share fascinating insights into the history and craftsmanship behind the Taj. Their stories bring the monument to life, weaving a narrative of love, loss, and architectural brilliance. They also know the best spots for photographs, helping you capture the magic of the moment.

One of the most thoughtful aspects of the visit is the battery-operated cabs that ferry visitors to and from the parking area. These eco-friendly vehicles ensure that the serene ambiance around the Taj Mahal remains undisturbed by pollution or noise. The short ride through the well-maintained approach road allows you to gather your thoughts and prepare yourself for the awe-inspiring sight that awaits.

As you walk through the grand entrance and the Taj Mahal comes into full view, you cant help but feel a sense of wonder and reverence. The shimmering reflection in the long pool, the peacefulness of the surroundings, and the sheer majesty of the monument create an experience that feels almost otherworldly.

The visit to the Taj Mahal is a journey not just through space, but through time and emotion--a truly surreal experience that stays with you long after youve left.

INR 20 per person for the golf cart ride from the parking to the east gate. 45 for the entry ticket and 200 more if you want to get inside the mosuleum. Carry your bottles, water inside is free.

For Japanese people, when they think of India, they think of curry, Dhalsim from Street Fighter, and one of the most famous things: the Taj Mahal.
Since I went on a tour, I left the purchasing of admission tickets and procedures to the guide.
A guide will accompany you to the viewpoint where you can see the Taj Mahal, but you will have to enter the Taj Mahal alone.
Once inside, a guide-like Indian man will give you a brief explanation in English and then ask for a tip, but there is no need to pay.
The guide had warned me about this beforehand, and I was able to understand it by actually facing it.
You can request a photographer outside to take pictures through the guide, but the guide will take the pictures with his own camera (smartphone), so unless you want to use a good camera, there is no need to ask for one. I thought.

One of the main attractions of the architecture is the symmetry, such as the twin mosques placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum, and how it changes color throughout the day depending on how the sun strikes it.
The monument has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Inside are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan.
The beautiful cenotaphs are actually replicas of actual tombs. Sarcophagi are located under the tombs, at the garden level. It is a myth that Shah Jahan chopped the hands of those in charge of building the Taj Mahal. If you wish to learn more about the history and monuments, you can hire a government-authorized tour guide. A ticket for Indians costs 50/-, but to visit inside the Taj Mahal, you must pay an additional 200/-.

The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million).

The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperors court architect.

For a first-time visit, the beauty and size of the monument are really impressive. The design and structure are amazing, and its clear why its such a famous site.

Theres also a lot of interesting history to learn about the Taj Mahal, which makes the visit even more worthwhile. Its fascinating to see such an important piece of history in person.

However, I feel that one visit is enough for me. While the Taj Mahal is beautiful and worth seeing, I dont think I would go back a second time.

Overall, I would give my visit 4 out of 5 stars. Its definitely worth going once to see the stunning architecture and to learn about its history.

The whole experience was incredible! The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and its intricate details are mesmerizing. For the best and most scenic views, visit either early in the morning or in the evening when the light creates a stunning atmosphere. A few tips: avoid bringing luggage or large bags, as they must be checked or stored in a locker. Keep in mind that Fridays are a holiday, so plan accordingly. I highly recommend booking your tickets online to skip the lines and enjoy more of your time at this iconic masterpiece.

Some people call it a must-see while others describe it as stunning and mesmerizing. Here are some insights from reviews:

Beauty

Most people see the Taj Mahal as architecture and beauty at its best because it changes color during different times of the day.

Time of day

Others say that sun rises up at six am when gates open. It is also said to be a busy place during sunset especially near marble seating.

Photography

It has also been mentioned that photographing inside isn't allowed but outside can be done from a distance. Security personnel will blow whistles on anybody who tries taking photos within the mausoleum's precincts since cameras may also be seized.

Other attractions

They also encourage tourists to visit other places such as Sikandra, Fatehpur Sikri and other tombs of Akbar, Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb etc in Agra beside famous AgraFort.

Taj mahal one of the destinations of our honeymoon trip. It was in the last of january. We started our journey from nizamuddin delhi.the sleeper coach is fully occupied , we got the company of a mother and kids.
It nearly takes 6 hours to reach.
Train was late for two hours.
By evening we reached agra. As per plan we moved towards the hotel by an auto.
Agra railway station is a nightmare for the tourists. The drivers canvases us and follows us also.luckly we got ola at a cheap rate.
Spends the whole night in a hotel besides taj and reached taj morning.

Every time I visit the Taj, I found something new and interesting. The building incorporates the traditional design of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. IThe Taj is also seen from the Red fort. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time.
The wall of Taj has beautiful design on precious stone and calligraphy over walls. It also has a large beautiful garden to relax and enjoy the beauty of Taj. Its atmosphere is also peaceful due to perfect location on the bank of Yamuna river.
One thing that you may find very strange, but the truth is that the Taj changes its colour three times a day. Colour changes are seen depending on the light and time.
The Taj Mahal looks pink in the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden in the moonlight. If you have visited the Taj Mahal more than once at different times, then you must have noticed that the colour of the Taj Mahal is different during the day and different at night.

And the gate manager who searches the belongings of Taj Mahal visitors confiscated even a palm-sized plastic fan to block the sun in the heat without knowing why, but people with other items of the same type passed without incident, which made me feel uncomfortable as I thought it was a search without standards. I heard.
Anyway, the Taj Mahal is worth seeing...

Feels awesome to see it the naked eyes, all I saw it was on pictures, movies and videos but the reality is super awesome.
The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden. It was built by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole world!! Hospitality of people nearby was also excellent, so its good from the tourism perspective.

It is must visit place when someone is in Agra, Delhi or nearby cities.

Its magnificent and is full of history . Beware of local guides while touring Taj or Agra. Meen bazar is must visit place. Beware of theifs and pickpocketers. Agra also has a metro so... Local transport is sorted.

Ticket facility is available online in archeological survey of India website. Go through it to avoid any money mongers.

Friday Taj visit is closed . Early morning visits will help you face lesser crowds.

Autos are available.. rate is 20 per person. You can carry bags with you only with permitted items .

Go as early as possible ~6AM to avoid the peak crowds and the heat during warmer seasons. Also, you should be able to see the first sunlight of the day falling on the mausoleum from the east.
Buy the entry tickets online it is more convenient and you may get a 5% discount.
Electric buggy service (Rs 20 per person)is available from the car parking to the main entrance and back.
Restroom facilities are well maintained.
They could make more areas of the mausoleum accessible and improve maintenance of the lawns and water fountains, etc.

As you can see in the photos and videos, it is a very beautiful place, and even now, even after all this time, I am glad I visited.
We had planned to go in casual clothes, but the night before we ended up running a tour guide (there were no other tour participants other than ourselves, so it was essentially a private tour), so both my husband and I wore rented costumes. I regret it a lot. Women are allowed to wear sarees, but men are strongly advised not to wear costumes. 95% of tourists are in casual clothes, so its easy to see.
There was a baggage check immediately after entering the venue, so it was a good idea to keep the minimum amount of luggage.
You can get shoe covers and bottled water a little further away from the entrance.
It was a weekday according to the Japanese calendar, but it was before Duwali, and many people from India were there.
Since it was a tour, I drove there from Delhi. It took about 4 hours one way at high speed, but there were several service areas along the way, so I was able to travel without worrying too much about bathroom breaks.

Some say its a symbol of the love between Shah Jahan and his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and that its a reminder of the power of love.
Others say its one of the best examples of Mughal architecture, which blends Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.
Here are some reviews from visitors:
Beauty: Some say the Taj Mahal is beautiful and evokes a depth of feeling. Others say its magnificent and serene.
Size: Some say the Taj Mahal is much bigger than they imagined.
History: Some recommend hiring a guide to learn about the history.
Architecture: Some say the Taj Mahals surface treatments are exquisite, and that its often described as a jewel box. Others say its characterized by a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex shapes, light shadow, arches and domes, relief work in marble, and inlay work with precious and semi-precious stones.
Other attractions: Some mention the twin mosque buildings, lovely gardens, and museum that are part of the complex",2 months ago,2024-08-22T15:20:41,,,null,0,80,22,1,null,null

I got a government approved Photographer to do a mini photo shoot for me and my wife. His replies were prompt. He promised to edit all our videos that were taken on my phone but he did a crappy job. The songs were old and totally not in sync. The editing looked like it was done by a 12 year old. He told us he would edit about 20 photos for us. However he only edited 18 and editing looked like it was done on an app in an iPhone. We paid 6K INR for the service but the service output looked like only worth 1-2K INR.

Be wary of such people if you want to do a photoshoot.

Its truly Magnificently Mesmerizing.

Words clearly cannot describe how beautiful it is. Be there to experience the grandeur of the Taj. Watch it from the garden, or from Mehtab Bagh or from anywhere far....or just walk towards it, The Taj is magnificent from every angle....

The Taj Mahal should definitely be on everyones bucket list.

The Taj Mahal is truly a masterpiece of the Mughal era, and witnessing it in person was mesmerizing. The intricate design of the tomb, the historical significance, and the beautiful garden surrounding it all contribute to its grandeur. There are plenty of spots to sit and soak in the beauty of this iconic monument. However, be prepared for large crowds--this is the most crowded place Ive ever visited. The lines to enter can be quite long, so plan accordingly. Also, the entry fee for foreigners is 1000 rupees, which is something to keep in mind. Despite these challenges, the experience is well worth it!

Probably the most perfect building in the world. A must visit if in India. Been lucky to have seen it twice now. Wow. Never fails to impress. Would recommend you hire a guide to get full experience and history. The architecture is near perfect - I'll leave it to you to spot the minor imperfection. The grounds are immaculate and the whole atmosphere is transcendal. I can't think of another site on this planet with a richer atmosphere.

Tajmahal has its own beauty which is really pleasant to see. We went there on weekends early in the morning and was surprised to see the crowd at that time. It was very crowded. So I guess there is no day when we see less crowd. People from all over the place came to adore its beauty. Weather was pleasant as it was monsoon when we went there. For tickets we purchased online but make sure to buy from ASI website as it will be easier to get in. For night view of tajmahal.. tickets are only available when there is full moon chances. Otherwise it is not available. Must visit place with family and friends. Make sure not to take any food items or plastic water bottles. Can carry Personal water bottles. Keep hats,cap handy in summers. For luggage cloak room facilities are available. To reach to taj mahal any of the gate, one can walk or can take golf cart with 20rs pp charge.

The architecture, in white marble with intricate handiwork and symmetry is majestic as you move closer. The tranquil gardens and pools that reflect increase the majesty, offering visitors a welcome respite from the busy surroundings. That it was built as a monument to Emperor Shah Jahans wife Mumtaz Mahal (heartbreakingly, she died giving birth) adds to the thrill of visiting. Oh the Taj Mahal, it will take your breath away no matter if it is in the sunrise or sunset! Required for anyone who want to experience one of the greatest things in this world.

Visiting the Taj Mahal is an experience like no other. The moment you set eyes on the majestic white marble structure, it's easy to understand why it's one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The intricate craftsmanship, symmetrical architecture, and the play of light on the marble at different times of the day are awe-inspiring. The monument, built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, exudes a sense of love and reverence, making the atmosphere both romantic and serene.

The well-maintained gardens surrounding the Taj add to its beauty, offering peaceful spots for reflection and photography. Early morning visits are highly recommended, as the sunrise casts a golden hue over the monument, making it appear almost ethereal. The crowd is also thinner in the early hours, allowing for a more intimate experience.

One point to note is the high level of security and the prohibition of certain items, so it's essential to check the guidelines beforehand. The entry fee is higher for foreigners, but it's worth every penny for the chance to witness this UNESCO World Heritage site. The local guides are knowledgeable and provide deep insights into the history and symbolism of the Taj Mahal.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is not just a monument; it's a symbol of eternal love and a masterpiece of human artistry that should be on everyone's travel bucket list.",2 months ago,2024-08-22T15:20:56,,,null,0,86,41,1,null,null

My family was happy to visit Taj Mahal and its exquisite beauty. We went on weekdays and there was still a decent crowd .. Try to buy tickets online prior to the time of visit. And its valid for 3 hrs.

If you just want to explore the beautiful monument from outside. Go for buying the tajmahal ticket.

But if you want to go inside the Mahal and see the infra, all other things ,then Buy tickets which are combined with tajmahal with mausoleum which costs around 200-250 rs.

You can take nice pictures and on return you can buy marble Taj Mahal and Agra pedha sweets which we missed to buy.

But, I would like to list the things which would make me think to never visit this place again in my lifetime
1. Ticket cost - 50(to see only the garden), 250(to go inside the mausoleum) - even this seems acceptable as they want to control the crowd visiting the mahal inside and preserve its heritage
2. Electric Golf cart - for taking one from the parking to entrance charged at 20/person(for less than 500m) - most imp is the tickets are not provided for everyone (given only those who asks for it) and the fare is taken by this drivers without any accountability to government.
3. Shoe cover - for going inside the mausoleum, the shoes need to be covered with the cover. But the reusable cloth cover(provided free of cost) has all the dirt than the shoes. Also the clean use and throw cover is charged 10 each separately (as a separte business inside) - wonder why all these are charged outside the ticket cost when we cant go imside without it
Its not about the amount they charge, but its about the unethical practice they are following.

Next to the entry gate youll find a booth offering free shoe covers and a small water bottle.

However, be cautious of potential scams. Even licensed tour guides may try to persuade you to purchase their special fast lane tickets, claiming that youll face long waits without them. In reality, there was no wait at all--no guide or special ticket needed. Additionally, the aggressive tactics of tuk-tuk drivers can be overwhelming, leaving a sour note on an otherwise remarkable experience.

The entry process has two main fees: 50 to enter the first gate and an additional 200 to go inside the Taj Mahal itself. Its essential to be cautious when dealing with guides. Many can be pushy, and some might try to overcharge or pressure you into additional services. If you plan on hiring a guide, make sure to confirm the price upfront and clarify what it includes. After your tour of the Taj Mahal, be sure to pay and settle the deal immediately.

Some guides might try to control your shopping experience by taking you to specific shops where they receive commissions, often leading you to a place falsely advertised as a mini Taj Mahal. These shops typically sell overpriced items. To avoid this, be firm in your choices and opt for exploring local markets on your own if possible.

The Taj Mahal is undoubtedly worth the visit, but a little caution can go a long way in ensuring a memorable experience.

If its your first time, its a must-see, but otherwise, I wouldnt make a special trip to visit again. It's one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Guides are advertised at Rs. 975, but you can often negotiate down to Rs. 500. However, if youre not particularly interested in history, you might prefer to explore on your own.

Its a testament to love, loss, and human ingenuity. Its ethereal beauty is almost overwhelming.
The pure white marble shimmers in the sunlight, and the intricate carvings are simply mesmerizing. The symmetry and proportion of the building are perfect, and the gardens that surround it create a serene oasis.
I visited during sunrise, and the soft pink hues that washed over the Taj were magical. Its an experience that will stay with me forever. However, I must admit that the crowds can be a bit overwhelming, especially inside the main mausoleum.
Despite the crowds, the Taj Mahal is a must-see for anyone visiting India. It's a place that truly takes your breath away.

I went to Agra for office work, I reached in the morning at 6 so I searched for a location to visit then I found that Tajmahal is a good option for time spent till 10 so I visited there location is good, monuments and everything is well maintained by tourism department, security is highly tight... And salute to those labourers who made Tajmahal... But the main attraction point is the ancient Shiva Temple, just before the entrance of tajmahal..must visit place for everyone

Auto can even wait if you want to have food in between. Please be aware of auto who tell you to take Meena bazar, at my knowledge Meena bazar is no more and group of 3-4 shop fool you as Meena bazar.

There at Taj Mahal you need to take a ticket of 50 to visit the outer area and ticket 200 to visit inside Taj Mahal. Tickets are available in nearby shops and government ticket counters near Taj Mahal.

Please visit during early morning or in evening and carry an umbrella or cap if you are visiting during the afternoon in the summer season

It was no season so got no long Que to enter
Entry was smooth dont get into the trap of auto wala that we will drop you there and the trap of cheap guides to make entry from the VIP lane just do the entry from metro station gate and take the electric vehicle they will take 20 to drop you to the Tajmahal entry gate and there are people standing there to assist you as we hired a person and be charged us only 300 for one hour and he clicked all the pics from our phone and then inside we hired a camera man also and took the soft copied from him in our phone that too 35/copy

I have been there many times but each time whenever i get the glimpse of the Taj from the main gate i get goosebumps... The magnificent building have some powerful attraction.
During weekends/public holidays it will attract as many as 35K tourists making it too overcrowded to have personal space for photography...
Best time to visit is from October to March month...
Visit early morning, to avoid rush if you are visiting it on weekends/public holidays
On Friday Taj is closed for tourists.

We had booked tickets online so there was no hassle, Rates are same, 50 for entry and 200 extra if you want to visit upper part (mausoleum). For foreigners and saarc country visiters the rates are different. Keep your identity proofs along, it is checked at the entry.

The only negative aspect I noticed when I was at the Taj Mahal was that I saw a guard beating a stray dog inside the palace. All the foreigners were shocked after witnessing that incident because the dog cried out in pain, and I saw his limbs swaying as if his bones were broken due to the severe beating by the guard or perhaps a police officer. As an animal lover, I was deeply shocked and disturbed by this incident, but unfortunately, there was nothing I or anyone else could do at that moment. I sincerely hope that animal lovers in India will take notice of this and work towards helping these poor dogs.

They give you a bottle of water and booties for entering the mausoleum when you pick up your tickets. Keep your eyeglasses and anything else loose and shiny secure by being aware of the monkeys, who will steal them right off your face, if they can, to get you to bribe them with fruit or juice to get them back (good luck). You can buy tickets at the entrance or online (online is easy, but dont mess up, as there are no refunds). If you goof up and dont get mausoleum tickets when you purchase your tickets online, you can buy the extra ticket there. A free electric shuttle will take high-value ticket purchasers (foreigners) through the combustion vehicle-free zone.

Doesnt disappoint. I recommend getting your tickets in advance online (you will avoid the queue to buy and you will arrive directly at the entrance queue, which at that time is short). The discount they give is better than the change. With these tickets they give you a discount of 50 rupees if you want to see the Red Fort later. Another option is to take them out in the morning and go just at dawn at 5:30, 5:45 or 6 and enter through the west door. Immediately go to the mosque area. From there, with the sun rising, the photos are spectacular. Next, go to the guest area (opposite side of the mosque) and with a mobile phone on the ground or spilling water on the ground you will get some impressive mirror photos. Then you can return to the central pond to take photos from the canal and finally from the cloisters. from the Darwan gate and at the entrance. The length of stay is 3 hours and be careful that they will constantly overwhelm you for guides, photos, etc. If it is not your plan, say no to everything. Transportation between the west gate and the entrance to the venue is free with admission. Otherwise its 20 rupees per person

Recomiendo sacar las entradas con antelacion on line (evitareis cola para comprar y llegareis directos a la cola de entrada, que a esas horas es poca). El descuento que hacen es mejor que el cambio. Con esas entradas te hacen descuento de 50 rupias si quereis ver el Fuerte Rojo despues. Otra mas, sacarlas de manana e ir justo amaneciendo 5:30, 5:45 o 6 y entrar por la puerta oeste (West). Inmediatamente iros a la zona de la mezquita. Desde alli, con el sol saliendo, las fotos son espectaculares. Seguidamente id a la zona de huespedes (lado contrario a la mezquita) y con un movil en el suelo o derramando agua en el suelo saldran unas fotos especulares impresionantes, Luego podeis regresar al estanque central para hacer fotos desde el canal y finalmente desde los claustros de la puerta Darwan y en la entrada. El tiempo de estancia son 3 horas y cuidado que constantemente os van a agobiar para guias, fotos, etc. Si no es vuestro plan decir a todo que no. El transporte entre la puerta oeste y la entrada al recinto es gratis con la entrada. Sino son 20 rupias por persona",null

This MAGNIFICENT MONUMENT, with its STUNNING ARCHITECTURE and PERFECT SYMMETRY, is a true TESTIMONY OF ETERNAL LOVE.

As I approached the entrance gates, I was immediately captivated by the IMMACULATE BEAUTY of the white marble that gleams in the sunlight.

Every INTRICATE DETAIL and every WELL MAINTAINED GARDEN around TAJ MAHAL contributes to an atmosphere of PEACE and TRANSIT.

Walking through the corridors and feeling the aura of devotion and respect is a PROFOUND experience.

The view of the YAMUNA RIVER in the background adds a touch of SERENITY to the already perfect setting.

Without a doubt, TAJ MAHAL is one of the WONDERS OF THE WORLD, and its BEAUTY and MEANING leave a lasting mark on the hearts of all who are lucky enough to visit it.

However, the crowd situation has improved recently, and it's not as crowded as it used to be. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting between 9 am and 12 pm when it's less crowded.
I recommend buying tickets online in advance. This will save you time and ensure a smoother entry.
There are two value tickets for Indians: one for appreciating the view from the garden area (Rs 50) and another for exploring the tombs from upstairs and inside (Rs 250).
Additionally, there's a higher value ticket (Rs 1300) that allows you to avoid the crowd at the main entry.

The beauty of the Taj Mahal is truly unmatched, and I had a great time exploring its majestic architecture.

One of the highlights of my visit was the availability of a cameraman who can take stunning photos for you, making it easy to capture those perfect memories. I even shared some of my photos, and they turned out great! However, I found the ticket price to enter the mausoleum a bit expensive, so I wouldnt recommend going inside unless youre very keen on seeing the interiors.

For those worried about staying hydrated, theres good news! You can get Pune water inside the premises as long as you have a water bottle with you.

Overall, it was a memorable trip, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Just be mindful of the additional costs if youre planning to explore every aspect of the site.

Rating: 5/5

The Taj Mahal is an awe-inspiring wonder that transcends time and leaves an indelible mark on the heart. This majestic monument, nestled in the picturesque city of Agra, India, is a testament to love, beauty, and human ingenuity.

As I stepped into the complex, I was struck by the sheer scale and symmetry of the architecture. The marble exterior, adorned with intricate inlays of precious stones, glistened in the sunlight, radiating an ethereal glow. The reflecting pools and gardens added a sense of serenity, creating a perfect harmony of nature and art.

The history and romance surrounding the Taj Mahal are palpable. The story of Shah Jahans devotion to his beloved Mumtaz Mahal, and the monumental tribute he built in her memory, is a poignant reminder of the power of love.

The attention to detail and craftsmanship are astounding, with every aspect of the monument showcasing the skill and dedication of the artisans who built it. From the calligraphic inscriptions to the delicate floral patterns, every element is a masterpiece.

Visiting the Taj Mahal is an experience that will leave you spellbound and inspired. Its a reminder of the beauty and wonder that human creativity can achieve. Whether youre a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or simply a romantic at heart, the Taj Mahal is an absolute must-see.

Tips:

- Plan your visit at sunrise or sunset to witness the Taj Mahal in all its glory.
- Hire a knowledgeable guide to uncover the rich history and secrets behind the monument.
- Respect the rules and regulations to preserve this incredible piece of history.

In conclusion, the Taj Mahal is an unforgettable experience that will etch itself in your memory forever. Its a celebration of love, beauty, and human achievement that will continue to inspire generations to come.",2 months ago,2024-08-22T15:22:01,,,null,0,22,56,1,null,null

This iconic ivory-white mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra is a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to India.

The intricate marble inlays, stunning symmetry, and majestic domes are awe-inspiring up close. The level of detail in the architecture and craftsmanship is truly remarkable, especially when you consider it was built in the 17th century.

The surrounding gardens and reflecting pools add to the serene atmosphere. Visiting at sunrise or sunset is particularly magical, as the changing light creates a mesmerizing effect on the marble.

While the site can get crowded, especially during peak tourist season, its well-managed with helpful staff and clear signage. Audio guides are available to learn about the history and symbolism behind this UNESCO World Heritage site.

Pro tips: Book tickets online in advance to avoid long queues, and consider hiring a knowledgeable local guide for deeper insights. Bring a good camera - youll want to capture every angle of this architectural gem.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is a bucket-list worthy experience that showcases the pinnacle of Mughal architecture and leaves visitors in awe of its timeless beauty and romantic legacy.

No pictures do justice to it at all. A true wonder of the world. Hope the government invests some money to clean the marble facade like it did during the pandemic lockdown.

Some tips for the visit:

a. Indian or not, definitely take a guide, each and every story is worth listening to and you will find a guide at Rs. 400-500

b. For some reason they do not allow mobile phone chargers. They dont allow power banks too. Cell phones are allowed.

c. Buy a foot cover if you are planning to enter the mausoleum. Definitely suggest buying tickets online to avoid the queues.

d. Take your time and dont fall for hawkers around the monument. 99% of the stores around the monument are frauds, they sell fake marble, leather etc. If you need a souvenir, ask for the UP Govt Handloom and gift stores

The stories I heard passed through my mind and I was speechless when I visited for the first time.Every one needs to visit and experience it atleast once in their life time.

During my recent visit people are allowed to enter and exit from the western gate only.

If you book the entry ticket online, can avoid the big queue. You can enjoy the real charm if you visit early in the morning or just before sunset. During the day it will be sunny (carry sunglasses & hat) and crowded.

Rs.50 for visit the outer area for Indians and need take another ticket for Rs 200 to visit the thomb of Mumthaz. Book online for Rs250 which is the easiest option. Counter available inside too where we buy ticket to visit the thomb.

No eatables allowed inside except water. No selfie sticks allowed. Friday visitors are not allowed.

Hiring a professional guide and photographer is helpful. Drinking water is available inside. Cloak room service is good.

Entrance too expensive in my opinion, being all 1500r (EU16.50) and including the whole site, interior of the Taj Mahal (without being able to take photos of the tombs), shoes and a small bottle of water.

I loved how organized everything is now... compared to a decade back. The whole path is pedestrian, and you may hire golf carts approved by the government at 20 Rupees per person. Pre buying the tickets on the archeological site was great. There is option where you may choose a combo of all monuments you want to visit with defined time zones. The foreigner vs Indian prices vary widely but better do it online and get easy access and entry. Also photographers are available at the entry and you may bargain a good deal. I got one for 2000 Rupees for 50 pictures to be Transferred immediately to my phone no hard prints needed. We bought the sunset taj and mosoleum for day one. For day 2 we only bought the sunrise taj. We also had a guide pre hired. The sunrise was cloudy and rainy but got us empty spots.

The story behind the Taj Mahal and the craftsmanship is incredible. I went as part of a tour, I would definitely recommend getting a tour guide as they can tell you all about the history.

We got there just before 8am and there were no wait times at all and this was a Saturday. There are photographers who will take your picture if you want them to but otherwise your tour guide will know all of the best spots to have them. I truly hope I get to visit again!

An amazing monument with an interesting history. A sight to behold. Cant miss for sure. Make sure you get a guide and let him show you around. And get there first thing in the morning.

For good experience try getting an online ticket of just entrance not the museum. Once you enter the taj mahal you can buy the museum ticket near the museum only depending on your mood.
Parking : Enough space to park your vehicle
Food : Have something outside in order to roam for 1-2 hours inside as you wouldnt get anything inside.
Things to avoid : dont carry food, drone, tripod or else youve to keep it in a locker which is free and safe.
Have a wonderful experience

Commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, the mausoleum was built in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. This architectural masterpiece took over 20 years to complete, with contributions from thousands of artisans and craftsmen from across the empire and beyond, including Persia and Europe.

The Taj Mahal is renowned for its breathtaking symmetry, intricate marble inlays, and detailed carvings. The central dome, standing at 73 meters high, is surrounded by four smaller domes and four slender minarets at the corners. The marble walls are adorned with precious and semi-precious stones, forming elaborate floral patterns and calligraphy of Quranic verses. The complex also includes a mosque, a guest house, and expansive gardens with reflecting pools, enhancing the sites serene and majestic ambiance.

Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the Taj Mahal is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indias rich cultural heritage. It attracts millions of tourists annually, making it one of the most visited monuments in the world. The Taj Mahals beauty and historical significance continue to captivate people from all corners of the globe, serving as an enduring testament to love and artistic achievement.

Built with bricks and covered with marble with some beautiful in lay work with semi precious stone material. This form of art is still practised and the products are available in Agra. The symetery of the architecture and certain optical illusions are amazing. Taj appears different at dawn, dusk, in bright sunlight and on full moon nights, Definitely worth adding to the bucket list make sure you carry just your phone and wallet. Bags are not allowed, and you will need disposable shoe covers by the ticket, which includes the mausoleum . Just outside, there are a few souvenir shops . My advice would be by a thing if you feel it is worth it, and then don't compare prices.

We were glad we hired a guide who made our trip really convenient by planning our the whole visit for us, taking pictures at all the right places, navigating through the crowds. Just all around a good experience given the circumstances. Would recommend this for everyone who visits taj for the first time and wants to make most of their visit.
Buy tickets online to make sure you do not have to stand in a line. And kids under 15 do not need a ticket.

Taj Mahal, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628-58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (""Chosen One of the Palace""), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor's inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India's most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.",3 months ago,2024-07-22T15:22:40,,,null,0,67,202,1,null,null

This guy Mohsin Khan (had the card and all that appeared genuine) tried to fleece about Rs1200 extra from the agreed amount from the boss. Quite unprofessional and aloof also, did not answer all the questions asked. We came there in a private car with a driver whom we have known for years and like a member of our family. This guy wanted a lift back to Agra town in the excuse that his motocycle had punctured and started a long tirade about friendship and advice to me on how the driver is at my beck and call. I wanted to cut him off while talking as I had recently retired as a Senior Govt servant in my country and have seen a lot of quacks like these in my working life. I contacted his boss and the boss apologised profusely and arranged the money to be returned to me. (Thank you). To Mohsin, if this line of work is not suitable get a 9-5 job where you can be supervised.

Agra's gastronomic offerings tantalize the taste buds with a unique blend of Mughlai and north india

The Taj Mahals Splendor
The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, is a true testament to architectural brilliance and everlasting love. This iconic monument was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1628 to 1658. He built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away in 1631.

The Taj Mahal's construction commenced in 1632 and was completed in 1653, taking approximately 21 years to build. It was constructed by a team of skilled artisans, architects, and craftsmen from various regions, including India, Persia (present-day Iran), and Central Asia.

The emperor's deep love for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, was the driving force behind the construction of this magnificent monument. Mumtaz Mahal was Shah Jahan's favorite wife and his trusted companion. When she died while giving birth to their 14th child, Shah Jahan was devastated and resolved to create an unparalleled tribute to her memory.

The Taj Mahal stands as a symbol of eternal love and devotion. Its construction was a labor of love, with no expense spared. The emperor envisioned a structure that would surpass any other in beauty, grandeur, and magnificence. The Taj Mahal's design is a fusion of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles, resulting in a breathtaking masterpiece.

The Taj Mahal's pristine white marble facade, adorned with intricate floral motifs and calligraphy, is a sight to behold. The symmetry of the structure, the minarets, and the grand central dome all contribute to its visual splendor. The meticulous marble inlay work, known as pietra dura, showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the artisans who worked on the monument.

Visiting the Taj Mahal is an experience that transports you to a bygone era. The historical significance and emotional resonance of this monument are palpable. It serves as a reminder of the enduring power of love and stands as a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage.

However, due to its popularity as a tourist attraction, the Taj Mahal can get crowded, especially during peak seasons. To fully immerse yourself in its beauty and appreciate its serenity, I recommend planning your visit during less busy periods or arriving early in the morning.

In conclusion, the Taj Mahal is an architectural masterpiece that reflects the depth of Emperor Shah Jahan's love for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its timeless beauty, intricate craftsmanship, and historical significance make it a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to India. Prepare to be awe-struck by the Taj Mahal's magnificence and let its story of love and devotion leave an everlasting impression on your heart.",3 months ago,2024-07-22T15:22:44,,,null,0,101,610,1,null,null

It is a beautiful site. Best to hire a guide (around 1000 rupees) before you arrive. Many pro photographers there who try to sell you photographs. We entered through the west gate and took an electric golf cart to get there 50 rupees each way for a family of 5. We were here in July (off season) and did not pre purchase tickets and had no wait time. It was very muggy, overcast and mellow inside. Worth the time to visit no matter what time of year!

The ebonies of the marble marble marble look crystalized in the light of the sun, and that marvel of human ingenuity and peaceful balance of form and design captivates the hearts of all who look or get inside at them. Taj Mahal is one of those lifetime experiences, whether each of the garden walls being a sculptural masterstroke, a poem. Be it the splendid visit of Taj Mahal, or strolling through its gardens or being mesmerized by its grand dome, you are quickly submerged in the powerful magnetos of the past and are competing to remember the unique, not leaving your mind the romantic love story is told over time. Were it not for a monument, it might have been a time-space continuum situation, a symbolic reminder of a marriage that alters in everyones lives who gazes. It is both a monument and a thorough walk through history, a worship of the unbent union that scares all those witnessing it for life.",3 months ago,2024-07-22T15:22:46,,,null,1,196,1296,1,null,null

Atiq Ur Rahman,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116373857908463912630/reviews?entry=ttu,5,"The Taj Mahal (Hindi: ttaaj mhaal, Urdu: taaj mhl) is a royal mausoleum located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan built this magnificent monument in memory of his wife Arjumand Banu Begum popularly known as Mumtaz. The construction of the monument started in 1632 AD and was completed around 1653 AD.

The Taj Mahal (sometimes simply referred to as the Taj) is considered a striking example of Mughal architecture, combining Persian, Turkish, Indian and Islamic architecture. Although the white marble domed royal mausoleum is the most admired, the Taj Mahal is actually a complex monolithic structure as a whole. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Taj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was then called a universally acclaimed masterpiece of world heritage.

Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful monuments and fascinating landmarks in the world. An incredible memorial sculpture of love. A magnificent example of Islamic architecture that symbolizes peace and beauty. In 1631 AD, Shah Jahan, the most prosperous emperor of the Mughal period, was deeply saddened by the death of his second wife, Mumtaz.

Construction of the Taj Mahal began after Mumtazs death. The main mausoleum was completed in 1648 AD and the surrounding buildings and gardens were completed five years later. The Taj Mahal has attracted many tourists since its construction. Even the small town of Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, on the south side of the Taj Mahal, was actually built to house tourists and markets to cater to the needs of tourists and artisans.

Currently, the Taj Mahal receives 2 to 3 million tourists, of which 200,000 are foreign tourists, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Most tourists come during the cold season in October, November and February. Air polluting vehicles are prohibited from approaching the Taj Mahal. Hence, tourists have to walk or take an electric bus to reach the Taj Mahal from the parking lot.

Currently, the cost of Taj Darshan is only 40 rupees for Indians. Taj entry fee for tourists from SAARC countries is Tk 530. And for the rest of the world it is 1000 rupees.

Archaeological Survey of India is also providing online tickets for tourists to visit the Taj Mahal from 25th December 2014.

Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum is celebrated for its exquisite white marble structure and intricate inlay work. Visitors often describe the Taj Mahal as breathtaking and a symbol of eternal love.

Most reviews highlight the best time to visit the Taj Mahal as early in the morning at sunrise to avoid the large crowds and to experience the beautiful morning light reflecting off the marble. The period from October to March is ideal due to the pleasant weather, though it can get crowded during this peak season. Off-peak visits, particularly during the monsoon season (July to September), offer fewer crowds but come with the challenge of heavy rains.

Travelers are advised to book tickets in advance, especially for sunrise visits, to ensure a smooth experience. The monuments beauty is often described as awe-inspiring, with many visitors stating that photos do not do it justice. The surrounding gardens and the view of the Yamuna River add to the serene ambiance. However, the site can be overwhelmingly busy, and its recommended to visit with a knowledgeable guide to navigate the crowds and gain deeper insights into the history and architecture of the site.

Overall, the Taj Mahal is praised as a must-visit destination that lives up to its reputation as one of the worlds greatest wonders.

- Very crowded. If you want a photo don't be afraid to go get it. 

- Wear comfy sandals.

- Costs more for tourists? Tourists may want to prebuy so you know how much you will spend. 

- Can not bring your own water in.  (Double check but you also may not be able to bring in power banks??)

- Pushy guides (but helpful and knowledgeable) 

-- Pushy guides....will have deals with vendors so you buy stuff when you are hot and tired. 

-- Photos included. If you get one of the pushy guides they will find a photographer who will take many photos and give you a very nice album (from my experience). 

- Cute Monkeys!!

About five million visitors visited Taj Mahal in the financial year 2022-23.A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2024, the fee for Indian citizens was 50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was 540 and for other foreign tourists, it was 1,100. Visitors are allowed through three gates and as polluting vehicles are not allowed near the complex, tourists must either walk or take electric buses from the designated parking areas. The complex is open on all days except on Friday from one hour before sunrise to 45 minutes before sunset.The complex is open for limited night viewing on the day of the full moon, excluding the month of Ramadan.In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.
The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the New Seven Wonders of the World, a poll conducted in 2007. Foreign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India.
The Taj Mahal was built on a small land plateau at the southern end of the circumscribed Agra city. Earlier, on this land there was a luxurious palace of Maharaja Jai   Singh of Jaipur under Rajputana state. Maharaja Shahjahan, in return, gave a large palace to Maharaja Jai   Singh of Jaipur in the middle of the city of Agra. An area of   about three acres was dug up, and by filling it with garbage, it was made fifty meters higher than the river level, so that there would be no dampness etc. Can be protected from. In the area of   the tomb, fifty wells were dug and filled with pebbles and stones to form a foundation. Then, instead of the traditional bamboo scaffolding, a huge brick structure, similar to a mausoleum, was built. This structure was so big that, according to the estimates of engineers, it would take years to remove it. The solution was that as per the orders of Shahjahan, the local farmers were given free rein to pick up as many bricks as they wanted in a day and the structure was cleaned overnight. To transport all the construction material and marble to the designated place, a fifteen kilometer long earthen slope was built. The stones were brought here by harnessing twenty to thirty oxen in specially made carts. A pulley system, consisting of an elaborate foot and beam, was created to move the pieces to their desired locations. The Rahat system was used to bring water from the river. Water from it was filled in a big tank built above. Then it was filled in three secondary tanks, from where it was transported to the places through tubes (pipes).",3 months ago,2024-07-22T15:23:02,,,null,0,67,15,1,"The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts a large number of domestic and foreign visitors.

This iconic monument is a breathtaking masterpiece, with its stunning white marble and intricate carvings. Visiting at sunrise offers a mesmerizing view as the monument glows with a soft, golden hue. The gardens are beautifully maintained, providing a serene atmosphere. Its an emotional and unforgettable experience, reflecting the timeless love story behind its creation. A must-see for anyone traveling to India!
Ive visited twice, and it never fails to impress. Hiring a guide is worth it to fully understand the history and details. The architecture is almost perfect, with a minor imperfection that adds character. The grounds are immaculate, and the whole place feels magical. If youre in India, the Taj Mahal is a must-visit.
Must visit in the early hours in winter.
The monument looks different at various times of the day, offering unique views. The reflection pool in front adds to its beauty, creating stunning mirror images. The interior is just as impressive with intricate marble inlay work. Be prepared for crowds, especially during peak tourist seasons. Despite this, the experience remains peaceful and awe-inspiring. The nearby Yamuna River adds to the scenic beauty of the location. You can also explore the smaller, charming buildings surrounding the Taj. Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes, as theres a lot of walking involved. Visiting the Taj Mahal is not just about seeing a building; its about experiencing a piece of history and a symbol of enduring love. The local markets outside are great for picking up souvenirs to remember your visit.

Get photographs clicked they charge 300 for 10 photos and transfer them to your mobile. Or 700 for 10 photos hard copies.

Ticket is 50 and 200 more if you want to go upside and inside.

No eatables are allowed inside, no kids toys are allowed, locker facility is available. Car parking is available. 20 rs charge for shoe cover, drinking water is available freely inside. Check online for facts and unique things about taj and feel yourself. It takes 2 hours at max for complete taj visit. Prefer going in the morning at 6 or at pleasant weather.

We arrived just before sunrise, spent 3 hours there (max. time allowed per ticket) and of course it was a highlight of our trip.

No queues at 5 am (on a weekday) to buy the tickets or entry. Staff were wide awake and helpful. A free bottle of water and shoe covers are given free.

You will be approached by guides and professional photographers, a polite refusal is fine.

Carry as little as possible in your bag to get through security smoothly.

Watch out for the monkeys in the outer compound.

Once inside the main area, amateur photographers will try to guide you to the best photo spots and take pictures for you with your phone.

We had a little old man do it for us (free at first, he never asked for money) at first we reluctantly accepted his help, and were SO glad we did. He knew all the best spots and angles. He took awesome pics and short videos so at the end we tipped him gladly.

Inside the mausoleum was worth the extra admission. The attendants inside will suck you in with rapid fire information, then ask for a tip.

There is a museum to the left of the main area but it only opens at 9am.

It was an effort to get up so early but well worth it to avoid the crowds and see the magnificent Taj Mahal in the early morning light.

Pity about the fountains and ponds being empty. Some renovation and getting them working would have made the main area even more magical and created a nice cooling effect.

But this was a small thing. We were so glad we came.

Unfortunately, the way to go there (the pathway from East Gate smells of pee. Plus once you arrive, a lot of tour guides will follow you and keep insisting you to take them as your guide, even if you already said no so many times. It really ruined the mood. And the vibes of the place.

It should be a magical place because a part of the world wonders, but too many local people who always push to offer something (guides, photographer, postcard etc) will really annoy tourists who are already tired from walking and the honks from the road, and want to just enjoy the place.

Hopefully, in the future, there will be a more organized system for the guides and photographers.

Capture the iconic central dome reflected in the still waters of the reflecting pool, or frame the monument through the grand archway. Whether youre a professional or an amateur, the Taj Mahal will leave you with unforgettable pictures.

A Must-Visit: The Taj Mahal is more than a monument; its a poem etched in marble. The experience is truly magical, leaving an indelible imprint on your memory. Dont miss the chance to witness this architectural marvel in person.

Taj Mahal is a renowned place and also under 7 wonders of the world, it was well organised pls book your ticket for entry online, it is easily available. Place was good enough, timing is strict from morning 11 to 5 in evening so plan your trip accordingly. You may face photographers approaching for photos, negotiate as per your convenience. We have clicked from our own phone and it was good enough. If you want to visit inside taj Mahal there is another ticket of aroung 350 per person I dont find it worth it.

#buy ticket online (full one so no need to be in line)
#rent a saree (7 min away from taj they have a shop for it 1000/2000)
#best time to go evening around 4pm
#museum working only 9-5pm
#you can get your shoes cover near taj main building
#plenty of drinking water spots
#toilets are in the end near the gate
#do your pics first and then go explore
#opening time 5am (!) be there early!!! Closing time 7.30pm
#you have only 3 hours to explore or you will pay extra fee
#it's not allowed to take videos on camera after arch
#no sticks, no suggests etc
#inside there are a lot of photographers you can buy pics from them, try it, they are really cool and know the spots

Life hacks:
# in the morning go at 5am with online ticket (just entrance) and take pics
#in the morning park is empty especially if you go close to white building and walk around, they have the best spots there for pics from the sides (no need a ticket)
#in the being go around 4pm and you can explore museum and main building, also have your pics with a best light (you will need a full ticket)
#pay for the guys and got your shots and videos quickly (1000-1500)
#morning time you can go for free to the river side it's the same view from there
#sunset time you can go also to the park in the cross river side (!) 300 and enjoy the view

If you buy tickets at the entrance, there is a small window where you will get free bottled water and shoe covers (so no need to buy from people offering them on the street if you dont want to). You can buy your tickets alone at the entrance, no matter what the people who approach you on the street tell you.

At the entrance, people say they work there and tried to offer free tours, free photos... all scams, of course, so always be careful and refuse anything you dont want to pay for.

There are water fountains inside TAJ, but there are no vendors and you cannot bring food.

Dont take a tripod, drone, cigarette, pen... the list of what you cant enter is huge.

At 2pm, TAJ wasnt that crowded, we were able to take beautiful photos, but when we were leaving at 5pm, the number of people had tripled. It was 35 degrees on the day and there are few shadows.

Inside TAJ you can take photos wherever you want, but some photographers try to convince you otherwise, dominating the best photo spots, as if you could only take photos there if you paid them. Dont accept this, organize your space and only leave after photographing as you wish.

Se voce comprar os ingressos na entrada, ha uma pequena janela onde voce pegara garrafa de agua gratuita e protetores para os sapatos (portanto nao precisa comprar das pessoas que oferecem na rua se voce nao quiser). Voce pode comprar seus ingressos sozinho na entrada, nao importa o que as pessoas que te abordam na rua te digam.


Na entrada, pessoas dizem que trabalham la e tentaram oferecer tour gratuito, foto gratuito.. tudo golpe, claro, entao esteja sempre atento e recuse tudo que nao quiser pagar.


Ha bebedouros de agua dentro do TAJ, mas nao ha vendedores e voce nao pode levar comida.


Nao leve tripe, drone, cigarro, caneta.. a lista do que nao pode ingressar e enorme.


As 2 da tarde, o TAJ nao estava tao cheio, pudemos tirar lindas fotos, mas quando estavamos saindo as 5 da tarde, o numero de pessoas tinha triplicado. Fazia 35 graus no dia e ha poucas sombras.


Dentro do TAJ voce pode tirar foto onde voce quiser, mas alguns fotografos tentam te convencer do contrario, dominando os melhores pontos para foto, como se voce so pudesse tirar foto la se pagasse a eles. Nao aceite isso, arrume seu espaco e so saia depois de fotografar como quiser.",null

Visiting this UNESCO World Heritage Site is an experience unlike any other. As you approach the white marble facade, its delicate beauty takes your breath away. The sheer scale and intricate details leave you speechless.

Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is more than just a tomb. Its a testament to enduring love, a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, and a symbol of India itself.

Be prepared for crowds, especially during peak season. Purchase your tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. Also, photography inside the main mausoleum is not permitted.",3 months ago,2024-07-22T15:23:39,,,null,0,180,144,1,null,null

Crown of the Palace) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately 35 billion (US$77.8 million).

The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperors court architect.

Must visit atleast once in a life time.

Dont take guide.. if u want take then for 300 to 400.. also Avoid professional photographers unless u wanted a printed photo.. i paid about a lot(only for soft copies) and then came to know that they cheated me.. they didnt accept for less than 10 photos. And they charge 40 rs for each photo.. seems 20 rs is reasonable for soft copy as they are taking more photos.. my phone camera quality was actually good... I should have considered photographers when i exit the taj mahal.. they were very rude also...

There s a museum inside the campus.. you can find very interesting things used by moghuls.. i liked the plate that turns color or breaking into pieces when it is exposed with poisonous food.

Car parking 100 rs.. take 20 rs battery operated car for 1km ride to reach the main gate.. get tickets online if possible..

There is a clock room to keep things.. food items are not.allowed.. selfie sticks are also not allowed..

Purchase shoe cover for 10 rs for mausoleum visiting.. photography is prohibited inside mausoleum..

That being said, advice to visitors - DO NOT get tour guides, I got one and all they do is blabber random facts all the time and kind of ruins the peacefulness of the place and waste your time. My guide would not shut up and let me go near the Taj Mahal, and on top of that they push you to buy random things from vendors. These guides are suppose to be authorized, but please don't get it. I suggest googling facts about Taj Mahal before going there and then just enjoy the place by yourself, take in the beauty of the Taj Mahal.

I visited it at dawn and the feeling was incredible! The sun was caressing the marble and the light projected was perfect! I bought the ticket at the time without any problem and thats it! Keep in mind that there are a lot of things that you cannot bring inside the venue, such as a selfie stick , pens, notebooks, books... The experience was incredible!

The English speaking tour guide told me that the entrance ticket was 3000 rupees, but after checking the information online in advance, I told him that it wouldnt cost that much and I would buy it myself at the ticket office.

If I bought it myself, it would have cost 1100 rupees.
Instead, I was told that there was an additional fee to go inside the Taj Mahal, so I didnt go in, but when I saw it later on Youtube, it didnt seem like there was a separate fee. Even after leaving India, I still dont understand.

The Taj Mahal, one of the seven most mysterious wonders of the world, is a must-visit spot.

For the story behind its construction, it is axiomatic to say that it is one of the greatest monuments to love ever built. Thousands of workers labored for over 20 years on the building, embellishing it with outstanding decorations including white marble screens and pietra dura inlay with semiprecious stones. At over 200 feet (60 meters) tall, the structure is the tallest Mughal tomb ever built and is considered to be the single greatest work of Mughal architecture. It is the centerpiece of a sprawling complex of buildings, courtyards, gardens, and waterways on the edge of the river Yamuna in Agra. Most of this original landscape is intact.

The Taj has long been recognized for its outstanding beauty and architectural merit, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982. It is one of the national symbols of India and receives millions of visitors every year. As with similarly famous, popular, and fragile sites around the world, this huge influx of tourists imperils the physical fabric of the monument. In addition, although new industrial development in Agra has been banned and only non-polluting vehicles are allowed near the Taj, environmental degradation is still a major concern for the conservation of the mausoleum and the structures that surround it. In 1996 in a historic judgement the Supreme Court of India ordered measures to preserve and protect the environments of Agra to safeguard the Taj Mahal's marble facade.

Ticket booking counter also opens before sunrise. I would suggest to take an official guide as it is very helpful and it ensures that we are not getting cheated by any local fraud and it make sense as they bring good information about the places which we cannot get by our own. Battery vehicle are available from car parking/ booking centre to Tajmahal. Tajmahal is closed on Friday.

essay on Taj Mahal

Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people associate India with the Taj Mahal. However, for me, more than the spectacular architecture, it is the story behind it that fascinates me the most. This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of a husbands love for his wife. Furthermore, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for future generations.

Taj Maha - Symbol of Love
The famous Taj Mahal was brought to life from the vision of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He built this memorial for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her death.

To honor the memory of his beloved wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from around the world to create it. He wanted to create something that had never been created for anyone before. The king wanted to give his last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.

Tourist guides and photographers are available. Tourists should bargain with them . Some have propensity to cheat.

Online booking helps to skip lines. We visited at around 2 pm on a weekday. It was not so busy. It took us around 1 hour to see the entire monument.
Security is tight here. Tourists are not allowed to carry big bags . Only small bag with water bottles, purse etc is allowed.

It was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal stands as a testament to love and is recognized as the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage.

Here are some key facts about the Taj Mahal:
Location It is situated on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra
Construction The construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but the entire complex was completed in 1653
Architecture The Taj Mahal is a prime example of Mughal architecture, combining elements from Indian, Persian, and Islamic influences3.
Complex The 17-hectare complex includes a mosque, a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
It attracts more than five million visitors a year and was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative in 2007

The Taj Mahal is not just a historical monument but also a symbol of the rich cultural heritage of India. Its open for visitors except on Fridays, and the visiting hours are 30 minutes before sunrise up to 30 minutes before sunset2. If youre planning a visit, its truly a sight to behold and a marvel of architectural beauty.

Rising before dawn, you can make your way to the entrance of the Taj Mahal, as it will be open at 6.00 Am. As the sun begins to rise, the Taj emerges from the mist, casting a spellbinding reflection on the tranquil waters of the reflecting pool. Walking through the ornate gate, you will be greeted by the sight of the mausoleum standing majestically against the azure sky.

The meticulously manicured gardens, is a symmetrical beauty that surrounds the monument. The lush greenery, interspersed with vibrant blooms, creates a sense of serenity and tranquility, contrasting with the grandeur of the marble monument at its heart.

Approaching the main mausoleum, you will awestruck by its sheer size and intricate detailing. While looking at a photo or distance we wont understand the enormousity of that structure due to its square base. As you ascend the steps, the marble facade reveals its delicate carvings and inlaid gemstones, each telling a story of love and devotion. Inside, the cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal lie side by side, a testament to their eternal bond.

Adjacent to the main mausoleum, the mosque and guest house stand as architectural marvels in their own right. The symmetry between the two structures is mesmerizing, with intricate marble lattice work adorning every surface. The Yamuna was dried up at that time as it was summer.

Its stunning white marble structure, intricate details, and beautiful gardens are breathtaking. I highly recommend visiting 30 minutes before sunrise for the best experience. Youll get to see the Taj during sunrise, and the place will be nearly empty. The monuments historical significance and sheer beauty make it a must-visit. The site is well-maintained, and the experience is unforgettable. Highly recommended for all travelers!

Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this iconic monument captivates visitors with its symmetrical beauty and exquisite details. The shimmering white marble facade, adorned with intricate carvings and inlaid precious stones, reflects the grandeur of Mughal architecture. As you wander through the lush gardens and marvel at the reflection pools, you cant help but be swept away by the romance and history that permeate the air.

It is a moment that will stay with you forever

As you approach the Taj Mahal for the first time, the anticipation builds with every step closer to its grand entrance. The air is heavy with a sense of reverence.

Passing through the threshold, you find yourself standing at the edge of a vast expanse of perfectly manicured gardens.

The sound of flowing water from marble fountains fills the air, lending a soothing rhythm to the atmosphere.

And then, as you turn the corner, there it is, The Taj Mahal in all its splendor

As you draw closer, you can see the delicate details carved into every inch of the structure, from the intricate marble lattice screens to the delicate inlay work of precious gemstones.

The intricate patterns of floral motifs and geometric designs across its surface catching the light is a mesmerizing display of craftsmanship.

Its a must visit place to see when visiting India

Located in Agra,uttar pradesh this cultural and historical monument is undoubtedly mesmerizing .Best time to visit is morning or evening so that you can relax and enjoy the beauty the place has to offer .
Gov. approved photographers are available at affordable rates. And best time for photography will be in the before noon as it will be less crowded that time.
The place is accessible by metro,
flight( Agra Airport), train( Agra Cantt)
and bus.
And its better for tourists to take Ola,Uber instead of getting scammed by local taxi people.
Entry fee is Rs.50 & 250 to get inside taj mahal .Rate is different for foreigners.Tickets can be taken online also.
There is also free cloak room inside and food items are not allowed inside.

Public toilet was awful not at all clean despite charging money to access it,They have not maintained it well.

The aura of the Taj Mahal is tangible and something you don't experience in many places globally.

Highly recommend choosing to either view at sunrise 6-6:20 am (which we did) or doing a sunset visit. We also had a guide arranged through our hotel (Mohsin) who was incredibly knowledgeable, spoke perfect English and handled all elements of ticketing (~PS10pp) / queuing / taxi and transport.

Once we arrived at 6am there was a pretty chaotic queue to get onto an electric buggy as the Taj Mahal area is a low emission zone.

Arriving at the entry gate after securing our tickets there is a short walk through one of the gates before you start to see the Taj Mahal and enter via the main gate.

The aura of the Taj Mahal can be felt instantly, the beauty of the building is incredible as are the surrounding areas such as the gardens and water features. Spend time to soak it in and naturally you will have to deal with 100s of tourists taking photos so I recommend taking a step back and appreciating it for what it is (also why the earlier you visit the better)!

Enjoy some time in the gardens and the short walk to the Taj. Once there you will need to wear shoe covers and you can enter and walk around inside in a guarded circle. This gives you some time to appreciate the craftsmanship, the design and the cultural heritage. Once you leave you have a view from either side as well as being able to see Agra Fort in the distance.

An incredible experience and one not to be missed!

Note the Taj is open every day of the week between sunrise and sunset, except Fridays, when it is only open in the afternoon when people are attending the Taj Mosque for prayers.

Luggage needs to be submitted before going in. It is a beautiful structure. There is a seperate ticket to go inside the monument after you get in which is 200 rupees. You wont usually get network inside.good experience.

Taj is breathtaking. It is cleverly hidden from the view when you approach it either from the West gate or the east gate. It is only when you cross the red stone entry gate (which is beautiful on its own) that it suddenly appears in its full grandeur. One cannot help but take out a camera and click a few dozen pictures.

A couple of tips for first time visitors

1. Try to take the early morning ticket. The morning entry begins 30 minutes before sunrise and it is wonderful to watch the Taj at sunrise

2. Book tickets online. It will save you a lot of time. The tickets cost Rs 45/- for Indians and Rs 1,050/- for a foreigner.

3. If you want to enter the mausoleum its Rs 200/- more per person. Its worth it .

4. The line for foreigners is really really long so try and queue up early.

5. Kids below 15 years both Indian and Foreign, get in free
