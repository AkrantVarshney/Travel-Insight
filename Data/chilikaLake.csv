The 4-hour journey across the stunning Chilka Lake was absolutely magical. Our boat driver was highly skilled and experienced, ensuring that we felt safe and comfortable throughout the trip. His expertise made all the difference, and we felt like we were in good hands, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the beauty of the surroundings.

The highlight of the trip was undoubtedly spotting the dolphins. Seeing these majestic creatures up close was an experience beyond words. One of the dolphins even swam right past our boat! Though I couldn't capture that perfect moment on camera, it's a memory etched in my heart forever.

We also came across vibrant red crabs and even witnessed pearl hunting, adding more wonder to the journey. Another highlight was reaching the **mohana**, where the lake meets the sea. The vastness and serenity of the place were breathtaking. The beauty of this spot is something that simply cannot be described--it must be experienced.

What made this trip even more memorable was the rain. Cruising across the vast lake, with the gentle rain creating ripples in the water, felt like something out of a dream. The combination of nature's elements made it an extraordinary adventure, one that will remain forever in the depths of my memory.

Overall, the Chilka Lake boating experience was nothing short of spectacular, filled with unforgettable moments of awe and wonder. I'll cherish this trip for a lifetime.",3 weeks ago,2024-10-03T22:38:56,,,null,0,130,691,1,null,null

One of Chilika Lakes most fascinating features is its **biodiversity**. It is home to over 160 species of birds, many of which are migratory and come from as far as Siberia and the Himalayas. The lake becomes a bird watcher's paradise, especially during the winter months, with species like flamingos, pelicans, and herons. The **Nalaban Bird Sanctuary**, located within the lake, is a key spot for observing these beautiful creatures.

Chilika is also home to the rare **Irrawaddy dolphins**, which can be spotted around Satapada, a small town near the lake. Dolphin watching tours are popular and offer an exciting experience for visitors.

The lakes **brackish water** ecosystem supports a rich variety of aquatic life, including prawns, crabs, and fish, making fishing a major livelihood for local communities. Chilika's waters are also famous for producing pearls, adding to its economic significance.

Boating on Chilika Lake is one of the highlights of visiting, with scenic rides available to islands like **Kalijai Island**, which has a famous temple, and **Honeymoon Island**, known for its serene beauty.

Boat Ride: The ride started with a tour of the lake, where we enjoyed the scenic views.

Second Stop: The next stop was Sea Mouth Island, where we had the chance to explore. We enjoyed tea and coconut water and discovered a beautiful sea view at Puri Seabeach, which was within walking distance. This part of the trip was the most relaxing and offered the best views. 

Dolphin Area: Finally, we were taken to an area where dolphins can sometimes be seen. Unfortunately, sightings were rare and not very satisfying.

Chilika Lake is Asias largest brackish water lagoon and the second largest coastal lagoon in the world. Its located in the Puri, Khordha, and Ganjam districts of Odisha state, at the mouth of the Daya River, flowing into the Bay of Bengal.
Chilka lake is about 50 -55 km from Jagannath Puri temple and is one of the largest ( approx 65km long and 8 to 22km wide ) saltwater lake of India.
A large section of the tourist going to Jagannath Puri definitely go to enjoy boating in Chilika Lake.

Spotting dolphins is quite tough but if you keep patience then you might be able to see a dolphin. You can also spot migratory birds but there is a particular season for that.
But before this, there are 2 major scams!! which can be avoided if you pay attention.
1) Chilika lake has 2 boating spots. One is controlled by the government called Satpada where boating rates are fixed and controlled by government. The other spot is owned by private players who charge extremely high prices for dolphin spotting. These people have partnered with majority of taxi drivers and therefore taxi drivers will take you to this private operated spot for their own commission. Even if you tell the taxi driver to take you to Satpada, he will still take you to this spot because of his own cut. Local people here will also claim this place as Satpada only but if you pressurize your driver then he might help you in negotiating the price or might take you to the actual place.
2) In the lake at some point, vendors will come to you showcasing red crabs and oysters with pearls. They will break the oyesters to show you pearls emerging from them. It is up to you whether to buy them or not.
About dolphin spotting :
Dolphins located here are blind. You have to be very attentive because they come only to the surface for breathing hence do not assume that you can spot dolphins jumping in the lake. They briefly come to the surface and then go back to the underwater. Since boats in the lake make a lot of noise, the operator will close the boat engines to maintain silence near the potential sightseeing area. Hence dolphins are usually sighted a little far from the boat. Spotting dolphins is 100% based on your luck.",3 months ago,2024-07-24T22:38:56,,,null,0,31,117,1,null,null

Chilika Lake, the largest coastal lagoon in India, is a mesmerizing destination that blends natural beauty with vibrant wildlife. Located in Odisha, it's a paradise for birdwatchers, especially during the winter months when migratory birds flock here from as far as Siberia. The lakes serene waters, dotted with small islands, offer breathtaking views that make for a perfect getaway from the hustle of city life.

A boat ride on Chilika is a must, allowing you to explore its vast expanse and catch glimpses of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins. The tranquility of the lake, coupled with the sight of dolphins playing in the water, is a truly memorable experience.

The surrounding villages, rich in culture and tradition, add to the charm of Chilika. Visiting these villages gives you a taste of the local lifestyle, including their unique handicrafts and cuisine.

However, the infrastructure around Chilika could use some improvement. Better facilities and waste management are needed to maintain the lakes natural beauty.

The journey begins with multiple points to embark on your adventure, allowing you to customize your exploration of this natural marvel.

The boat ride takes you through a spectacular journey, offering glimpses of the Bird Sanctuary, Red Crab Point, Dolphin Point, Rajahansha, Island, Sea Mouth, Nalabana, Kalijai Temple, and the enchanting Mangrove Plantation. Its advisable to confirm the itinerary to ensure you dont miss out on any of these breathtaking locations.

While the boat services might seem a bit expensive, the views and experiences justify every penny spent. The scenery is nothing short of stunning, with birds gracefully soaring overhead, dolphins playfully leaping in designated areas, and the vibrant red crabs making a striking appearance at the Island and Sea Mouth.

A visit to the Island adds an extra layer of fascination to the journey. Here, locals share their knowledge about Pearl Gemstones, which are cultivated in the ocean beds within oysters. The process of extracting these gems, along with a display of various other stones and species, adds an educational and entertaining element to the trip.

Chilka Lake is known to be a largest lagoon in India and posses' significant importance in flora fauna point of view.

I am writing the review based on my recent visit as a tourist.
Approach: It was around 1 - 1.5 Hrs journey by car from Puri to Chilka. The approach road crosses several villages, and the road needs to be widened as cattles can be identified seating on road that will disturb your speed to a greater extent.

Best time to visit: May be December, as other months have high temperature, and you will struggle to accommodate with atmospheric moisture and temperature while roaming around the lake.

How to initiate the journey?

The main tourist attraction is boating across the lake to some of the points such as Dolphin center, red crab point, island.
To initiate the boating, one must take ticket worth rs 5000 INR for a boat (Speed boat) for 3-4 hrs. Life jacket is being provided that is worst to wear due to dirty and dusty appearance and bad smell.

The near by shops for biscuits and cookies have very high price for everything almost double. Hence it is recommended that you bring the eateries along with you as it may required during boating as you will find this food as only source of entertainment while you will be in boat for next 3 - 4 hours.

Boat:
There are two types of boat, slow and fast. You must pay 200 INR additional fees for speed boat. Boat appearance is Ok and doesn't match with the fee you have paid. It is good for 6 adults and 2 kids. Motor of the boat is very irritating due to its high noise that will restrict you to have a conversation with your family and annoying throughout the time.

While Boat:
15 - 20 minutes you may enjoy while boating, having a look on ambience, photo, etc.
Your disappointment starts when you will find nothing after 20 minutes, it may be a miracle if you find Dolphin somewhere in lake. Other than annoying motor sound you will find nothing. All the three points mentioned in the Lake visit ticket, menu is boring and doesnot hold good.

Overall: May be one time visit for family (prefer some other tourist spot rather than wasting time and money)",a year ago,2023-10-24T22:38:58,,,null,12,52,73,1,null,null

Totally agree dolphins being present and crabs too.

But weigh in the pros and cons. Pros being you'll be able to see wildlife and brackish waters.

Cons are plenty. Before you even reach this lake, you'll be tried to stop by plenty of people on their bikes and they'll take you for a boat ride. All scammers.
The lake has strong current. Life jacket provided is extremely dirty. Torn. Truth be told, it's going to take your life than save it if you fall.
That boating centre. Satapada boating centre. That's a massive scam in itself. It is situated before the end of the road and they FORCE vehicles to enter their boating area by telling there's nothing further. 4750 for 6 people, 4 hours. The boat is broken, which they obviously don't show before. Good luck saving your lives if you fall or worse, the whole boat sinks.

There's a government hotel after this boating centre, if you do not take the turn to the left side. HEAD STRAIGHT AFTER THIS BOATING CENTRE SIGN. Government rates are 1700, 4 people 3 hours. Entry is 20 for vehicles with parking. As of January 2024. Enjoy the lake from the boat area. A museum, park is also at this place.

All in all, do not go boating in Satapada boating centre. You've been warned. You'll be scammed. Do not stop vehicle on the road if someone tells you to because they drive boats.

It's a beautiful lake and wildlife. But ugly humans surrounding it. Sad to say that.",8 months ago,2024-02-24T22:38:59,,,null,5,61,222,1,null,null

Our cab driver first took us to Dolphin restaurant, situated on the side of lake, for pre-booking of lunch and then to the ticket counter of private boat owners, where the rates were Rs. 4600 and Rs. 3800 for 4 hours and 2 hours boat rides respectively. Before starting the boat ride, we bought few packets of foods meant for Seagulls and Dolphins from the local vendors. No life jacket was provided, so the ride was at own risk. It was a noisy motored boat; it took around one hour boat ride for viewing Dolphin. The ride was enjoyable under cool breeze, best part was spotting seagulls, those flying close to the boat for foods, offered by us. In the middle of the lake, the boatman cuts-off the engines to spot the dolphins. However, there were number of noisy motored tourist boats in the middle of lake that most probably drive-away the dolphins from the site. While my family members could see some glimpses of dolphins, unfortunately I could not. In short, the dolphin watch is like you blink you miss.

In return we were first taken to so called Red Crab Island. Due to high tide, the Island was submerged and was like a part of lake. Post showing couple of red crab in a bucket, the man started selling the pearls and gemstones. The man showed some shells and corals and started breaking the same in front of us. After few failed attempts, the pearls and gemstones started appearing from the broken shell and corals. As it was our first trip and also it looked so convincing, we got into their trap and ultimately bought some pearls and gemstones at bargain price. Later-on, we learned that the gemstones are fake.",2 years ago,2022-10-24T22:38:59,,,null,4,143,2693,1,null,null

The Chilika lake is very huge and if you decide to have a complete tour of it, it will take months to finish. Once you reach the boating point you can see several people who run private boats, we have opted for the government boats. The price for the boating is too high which is around 8000 per boat with 20 people and for that you have to manage those 20 people.
At last, we couldn't make 20 people so somehow we convinced the manager and paid 550 per head for 8 people.
I must say that it was one of the most magnificent journeys of around 3 hours, the good part is that they gave us enough time to explore the places, plus we were so lucky to spot many dolphins and that was too amazing to experience. We have seen many beautiful birds as well.
They also take us to one of the beaches which meets the lake at one point, we couldnt go at that point due to the heavy surcharge of the sand.
Make sure that you either go with the government boats or private boats at the start point of the lake.

It always is full of migratory birds although during their seasons usually winter the charm is just charismatic. The lagoon is covered by lush green herbs n shrubs all around the vicinity, we could figure out many cashew trees on the way to reach chilika. The lake area is huge which allows us to go for a ferry or small boating organized by localities here. There is facility of guest houses for goverment employees as well as pvt Ltd employees too if you are keen on birds and species can try them out. One needs to get the bookings done for boating (it seems a little extra money at first but once you view those beautiful species all at once the amount is nothing). Because I personally feel it is better to be seeing the all the species in their totally open natural habitats. Please note Nalabana bird sanctuary is open only in Winters so take care that is the best time to visit youll be left spellbound seeing the colours. Can truly fill in camera with GBs of memories and many unknown birds. We were lucky enough to spot jumping dolphins all around because it was raining and they were like dancing to the tunes of thunder. Sad part is the sound of propellers or trawlers scare the majestic dolphins at times. Also spotted many migratory birds and felt like camera cannot capture them all when it is beauty all around, you need to save in your heart and soul. Another good point is when the boats halt (depends on which tour you choose while booking tickets) there are a few hutments on shore or tiny islands you can say with sea food and tender coconuts throughout the whole year so you may grab in a quick lunch as the sail on so big lagoon becomes long at times 3 plus hours with salty breeze.

We paid Rs. 3000 for 6 people for what was supposed to be a 2.5 hour long boat ride with two activities (seeing red crabs on an island and dolphin sighting). On our first stop for the red crab activity, we reached a little island that had 3 people. We saw the red crabs. Then came the fun part. One of the guys showed up with some clams and started extracting pearls from them left right and centre. We had no idea that clams generated pearls but the extraction process was so believable that we went with it anyway. We even tried our hands on the extraction process. The pearls felt plasticky to touch and a little too machine finished but we had no other reason to believe that he was faking it. He also managed to sell us two of the ""pearls"" for Rs. 150 each. This was after a lot of haggling. Previously he wanted Rs. 700 per Pearl. LOL.

He then proceeded to bring out some ""reefs"" from which he extracted emerald, ruby and Topaz. WHAT! We couldn't believe our eyes. But the extraction process looked EXTREMELY legit. Thankfully we didn't gullibly make any more purchases. Soon after this experience, we found out this entire gem stone extraction thing is a well known scam that has been running at Chilika Lake for years.

We proceeded to the next activity i.e. Dolphin sighting. It took us 1.5 hours to arrive at the location on the lake where the Dolphins are sighted usually. We saw absolutely no dolphins so that was a bust.

The reason why I gave the lake a 4 star is because the boat ride, albeit 1.5 hours longer than was promised to us (total 4 hours) was really relaxing and breezy. We lay down on the boat and took in serenity and the views. Was it worth 3k? Maybe. Would I do it again? No.

My piece of advice for people who are visiting the lake: please call out the Gem stone guy on his fake business. And if you have other activities planned for later in the day, strongly advise your boatman to not exceed the promised timelines.",3 years ago,2021-10-24T22:39:02,,,null,27,48,142,1,null,null

Spanning over 1,100 square kilometers during the monsoon season, it is separated from the Bay of Bengal by a narrow sandy ridge. The lake is an ecosystem with a large fishery resource, supporting the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. It is renowned for its dynamic ecosystem, which hosts over 160 species of birds in the migratory season, including the rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins.

Declared a Ramsar site in 1981, Chilika Lake is a significant wetland of international importance, attracting eco-tourists and nature enthusiasts from across the globe. The lakes vast expanse is dotted with a number of islands, each with its own distinct flora and fauna. Nalabana Island, for example, is a birdwatchers paradise, turning into a breeding ground for birds during the winter months.

Chilikas unique biodiversity is not only a crucial habitat for wildlife but also a vital source for studying and conserving various species. The lakes scenic beauty, coupled with its rich marine and bird life, makes it a popular destination for boating, bird watching, and fishing, offering a serene escape into nature.

Efforts by the government and various NGOs to preserve the lakes ecosystem have seen significant success, including the revival of the population of Irrawaddy dolphins and an increase in the arrival of migratory birds.

Some of the prominent islands like Nalabana, Kalijal, Somolo, Honeymoon, Break-fast, Birds and Rajahansa inhabited by small subsistence fishermen families, are popular destinations for daily boat trips. Because of its rich bio-diversity and socio-economic importance, Chilika was designated as a Ramsar site in 1981 to afford better protection.",5 years ago,2019-10-24T22:39:03,,,null,0,186,702,1,null,null

It is the largest coastal lagoon in India and the second largest coastal lagoon in the world[4][5][dubious - discuss] after The New Caledonian barrier reef in New Caledonia.[6]

It is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds on the Indian sub-continent. The lake is home to a number of threatened species of plants and animals.[7][8]

The lake is an ecosystem with large fishery resources. It sustains more than 150,000 fisher-folk living in 132 villages on the shore and islands.[9][10]

The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Mongolia, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; migratory birds probably follow much longer routes than the straight lines, possibly up to 12,000 km, to reach Chilika Lake.

In 1981, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importanceunder the Ramsar Convention.[11][12]

According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians.[13]

The highly productive Chilika Lagoon eco-system with its rich fishery resources sustains the livelihood for many fishermen who live in and near the lagoon. The water spread area of the lagoon ranges between 1165 and 906 km2during the monsoon and summer respectively. A 32 km long, narrow, outer channel connects the lagoon to the Bay of Bengal, near the village Motto. More recently a new mouth has been opened by CDA which has brought a new lease of life to the lagoon.

Microalgae, marine seaweeds, sea grasses, fish and crab also flourish in the brackish water of the Chilika Lagoon. Especially the recovery of sea grass beds in recent years is a welcoming trend which may eventually result in re-colonizations of endangered dugongs.",6 years ago,2018-10-24T22:39:03,,,null,2,51,90,1,null,null

BEWARE the red crab-spotting and pearl-semiprecious stone SCAM!

Long version:
Its a large lake, good for a serene boat ride. We caught a glimpse of a dolphin, some kingfishers and other birds. But we had gone late morning; an early morning trip would probably be better for birdwatching and dolphin sighting.

The dolphin sighting-red crab spotting boat ride is a total scam. 5250 for a five-person boat ride (actual ride lasting only about 1 to 1.5 hours). The booking office didnt have any official rate signboard. When asked about it the guy just shrugged and avoided the question. Also, we were told each boat carried only five passengers so we were forced to book two boats for our nine family members. During the ride, we saw several other boats taking 10 passengers.

The boat ride package included a visit to a beach to spot some special large red crabs. The boat stopped at one lake bank. A guy got in with a medium sized kitchen utensil and showed us some regular small grey crabs. He gave us some yarns about the crabs bodies and their eyes glowing bright red to signal an impending cyclone. A quick n quiet internet search revealed it was all nonsense.

It also struck us as odd that fishermen worldwide used their legendary skills by observing the sea, skies, winds and air moisture (and of course, official weather alerts) to anticipate cyclones whereas here, the fishermen go searching for fluorescent red crabs with satanic eyes.

The same guy then proceeded to show us oysters (actually, just regular clams), some diagrams and an explanation how pearls are formed etc. Then he broke open some clams one by one, expressing great regret at not finding a pearl inside. Then he chose one (probably with some identification mark) broke it open and gave a nice gasp of delight. He gently extracted a PEARL and excitedly told us how one in a thousand oysters yields such beautiful pearls (wow, we were so blessed!). He even placed it on a wooden plank and banged it with another plank to prove it was genuine and wouldnt break.

Then he went on to show us more semiprecious stones by breaking barnacles, luckily finding a rainbow crystal stones and a coral after breaking a few. He re-emphasized how fortunate we were and we could buy them for 650 per stone/ pearl whereas the same would cost us at least 5000 in shops.

What he didnt know was that some of us were expert in recognising real pearls and semiprecious stones from plastic beads.

I would have given Mr. Gemologist an Oscar Award for his acting but I didnt have one in my pocket at the time.

Needless to say, we played along and oohed and aahed all through his performance, but finally told him we were not interested. He grew irritated and persistently asked us why we werent buying them. We told him we had come to just sightsee and not buy anything. Visibly angry at our wasting his time (and some clams and barnacles), he suddenly got up and shouted at our boatman to take us away in Oriya language (perhaps including some native swear words at us ).

Then the boatman stopped at a beach with some huts selling coconut water--probably with some more scamsters waiting for us. By then we were bored with all this bullshi*t and ordered our boatman to take us back.

We realised that the whole boat ride was an elaborate scam, beginning right from the booking office guys, the boatman, the fake gem sellers and God knows who else. Worse, all this was going on under the very nose of the concerned Tourism department office. On searching the internet, several visitors mentioned similar experiences.

We had a good laugh about our experience but also felt saddened that many tourists especially foreigners were getting conned.",a year ago,2023-10-24T22:39:04,,,null,3,28,68,1,null,null
