After arriving at Veraval station, I took an auto ride to Somnath for Rs. 200, and though the journey was short, it built anticipation for what was to come. I checked into a hotel for Rs. 1600 per day, which, while modest in size with limited amenities, had an air conditioner--an essential relief from the heat. Although they promised hot water, it was unavailable, but this minor inconvenience was soon forgotten once I stepped into the serene and spiritual atmosphere of Somnath Temple.

The temple itself is a sight to behold--its grandeur and historical significance create an aura of timelessness. Walking through its corridors, I felt a sense of deep peace and tranquility, as if the weight of everyday life was lifted. The gentle sea breeze from the Arabian Sea, just steps away from the temple, added to the calming ambiance, making it a perfect place for reflection and spiritual connection. The energy of Somnath is palpable, and the spiritual solace it provides is indescribable. Whether youre a pilgrim or simply someone seeking peace, this temple is truly a divine sanctuary.

There is a train running everyday from Ahmedabad to veraval(nearest station to Somnath Temple). However, road connectivity is also very convenient except some parts after junagadh.

After reaching there just take a auto ride , hardly they will charge 30 rs per person. You will have a variety of homestay option there.
Also you can book a room in their trust , but you have to check availability before reaching there. For people who just want to take a shower , you can check some guesthouse near temple. They charge some amount and you can do your things there.

For temple premises: i would suggest wear a dress which is suitable for religious places. To avoid rush, try to visit there in early morning. You can buy silver coin and other things from temples shop. There are some other temples within a distance of 1 km from main temple. You can visit by walking as on the way there are other various temple of lord Ganesha, lord Ram etc.

After visiting temple, dont forget to visit triveni sangam. You can also take a boat ride at triveni sangam (meeting point of Hiran , kapila and Saraswati river). Now youre done with temple and all, after doing lunch take entry inside beach. You can visit the small market there and enjoy tasty food from their food stalls. You can also take a ride on bicycle ,its chargeable and can be hired at entry point itself. Dont miss the sunset at beach. You can go back to Ahmedabad from the same train leaving Veraval after 9 PM.

Its origins are uncertain, but it is believed to date back to the 1st millennium CE. The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times due to invasions by various Muslim rulers, starting with Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century. After India's independence, it was rebuilt in the Maru-Gurjara style under Vallabhbhai Patel's directive, with support from Mahatma Gandhi, and completed in 1951.

Strategically positioned along Gujarat's coastline, the temple is about 400 kilometers southwest of Ahmedabad. Historically, it was a significant trading port and a revered jyotirlinga site, known as Somnath, or ""Lord of the Soma."" Despite repeated destruction, the temple has been a symbol of resilience and Hindu heritage. The current structure showcases intricate carvings and remains a major pilgrimage site, symbolizing the enduring spirit of Hinduism.",4 months ago,2024-06-25T06:34:48,,,null,0,16,125,1,null,null

If you want to visit this place and if youre residing in Jamnagar, might as well take the Okha Veraval Express which is a 6.5-hour train ride. You can get down at Veraval station which is the nearest to Somnath town and there are many lodges available near temples with reasonable rates.
The old one was rebuilt by Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar during the 18th Century and the new one was commemorated by Sardar Vallabhai Patel. Theres a walkway beside the new temple where you can take a walk. The best time would be to go in the evening for a walk or visit the beach. You can also hire a cycle temporarily and someone who thinks about themself as a Shopaholic; there are plenty of small shops with bags, souvenir, clothes etc.

As I stepped through the gates, I was greeted by the serene ambiance and the fragrant aroma of flowers and incense. The intricate architecture and vibrant colors of the temple brought a sense of awe and reverence.

I took a moment to pause, letting the stillness envelop me. The chanting of prayers resonated through the halls, creating a soothing atmosphere that invited reflection and gratitude. As I stood before the deity, I offered my prayers, expressing gratitude for the blessings in my life and seeking guidance for the journey ahead.

The experience reminded me of the importance of faith and community, as I shared this sacred space with others, each lost in their own thoughts and prayers. It was a reminder that we are all connected in our search for peace and understanding.

Leaving the temple, I felt renewed and inspired, carrying the essence of this spiritual experience with me. May we all find moments of tranquility and connection, allowing our hearts to open to the divine and the beauty of life around us.

This idol was in the middle of the temple without anything to support it from below, or to suspend it from above. It was held in the highest honour among the Hindus, and whoever beheld it floating in the air was struck with amazement, whether he was a Musulman or an infidel. The Hindus used to go on pilgrimage to it whenever there was an eclipse of the moon, and would then assemble there to the number of more than a hundred thousand. They believed that the souls of men used to meet there after separation from the body, and that the idol used to incorporate them at its pleasure in other bodies, in accordance with their doctrine of transmigration. The ebb and flow of the tide was considered to be the worship paid to the idol by the sea. Everything of the most precious was brought there as offerings, and the temple was endowed with more than 10,000 villages. There is a river (the Ganges) which is held sacred, between which and Somnat the distance is 200 parasangs. They used to bring the water of this river to Somnat every day, and wash the temple with it. A thousand brahmans were employed in worshipping the idol and attending on the visitors, and 500 damsels sung and danced at the door--all these

Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this revered Jyotirlinga shrine has a storied past marked by numerous reconstructions due to invasions and natural disasters. The current temple, reconstructed under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the 1950s, blends traditional design with modern resilience.

Architecturally, the temples grandeur is undeniable. Its intricately carved spires and expansive courtyards are adorned with exquisite stonework that exemplifies the artistry of ancient Indian craftsmen. The temples primary sanctum, with its golden shikhara (spire), is an imposing and beautiful sight, enhanced by its coastal location overlooking the Arabian Sea.

A unique feature of the Somnath Temple is its alignment with the South Pole. This alignment was discovered during the recent reconstruction, showcasing the advanced astronomical understanding of its creators. The precision of this alignment adds a profound dimension to the temple's already deep spiritual significance.

The temple complex also offers an engaging evening experience with its spectacular laser show. Held against the backdrop of the majestic temple, the show vividly recounts the temple's rich history and mythology through a blend of light, sound, and narration. This visual spectacle not only enhances the visitors understanding of the temple's historical journey but also provides a breathtaking conclusion to a day of spiritual reflection.

Overall, the Somnath Temple is a confluence of historical grandeur, architectural beauty, and spiritual resonance. Its unique celestial alignment and captivating evening laser show make it a profound destination for visitors seeking both cultural enrichment and spiritual solace.

if come during day time than also go for the ocean walk with nominal entry tickets.

The temple has a huge dedicated parking space, digital locker, and is managed properly even with huge crowds.

Its highly recommended to see the laser show in the evening hours within the temple premises , please get tickets.

The temple has breathtaking views of the Somanth sea which you can watch and sync with waves while enchanting Shivs name.

Its a humble request to the Tourism of Gujarat and the temple authorities, to clear the waste dump yard behind the temple. (though its not sighted by many pilgrims and visitors but people like me ,who explore every nook and corner can easily discover and be disappointed with that sight of waste dumping).

Somnath Mahadev was worshipped by Chandra dev to overcome his curse given by Daksha Prajapati.

Soma means=> moon 

Thats why we call Shiva as Somnath Mahadev

Somnath temple is located beside the Arabian sea and we can Baan Stamb in the temple which indicates the direction for South pole this pillar existed from long time ancient scholars placed the Baan Stamb in the temple, there will be no land in the arrow direction to reach south side of earth.

As well known this temple was destroyed multiple times by Invaders to loot the gold from the temple.

After we got Independence Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji taken initiative to reconstruct the temple.

For luggage bags we have separate counters.
Even for Slippers we also have separate counters, all these counters were free no charges will be collected and This counters were managed by Sri Somnath Trust Authority.

We visited Somnath temple early at 6:00 AM in the morning trust me this is the best time to go for Somnath Mahadev Darshan we can see Harati (ceremony in which lights are lit and offered up to gods)will be offering to Mahadev which was pleasant to eyes  and heart  and also in the morning there will be no decoration for Somnath Mahadev We can see original Somnath Mahadev without any Ornaments and Garlands.

I felt so happy by visiting early morning  Darshan.

Inside Somnath temple they sell a variety of Prasad like Churma laddu,peanut chikki etc majority sweets were made of Wheat, ghee and Sugar.

We can feel Divinity in this temple for sure and also we can see destroyed temple part inside temple.

A big statue of Vallabhabhai Patel is placed in front of the temple entrance.

If you want to donate money to Bhramin from Somnath Mahadev temple we can donate through Somnath temple trust which starts from 150/-

The best known were the Mahatmya genre of texts. Of these, Somnatha temple tops the list of jyotirlingas in the Jnanasamhita - chapter 13 of the Shiva Purana, and the oldest known text with a list of jyotirlingas. Other texts include the Varanasi Mahatmya (found in Skanda Purana), the Shatarudra Samhita and the Kothirudra Samhita . All either directly mention the Somnath temple as the number one of twelve sites, or call the top temple as Somesvara in Saurashtra - a synonymous term for this site in these texts. The exact date of these texts is unknown, but based on references they make to other texts and ancient poets or scholars, these have been generally dated between the 10th and 12th century, with some dating it much earlier and others a bit later.

The Somnath temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, but the Prabhasa-Pattana is mentioned as a tirtha (pilgrimage site). For example, the Mahabharata (c. 400 CE in its mature form)[citation needed] in Chapters 109, 118 and 119 of the Book Three (Vana Parva), and Sections 10.45 and 10.78 of the Bhagavata Purana state Prabhasa to be a tirtha on the coastline of Saurashtra

You will definitely get the chance to get blessings of Somnath dada. The facilities are good and you can visit the main mandir (temple) as much time as you can if not satisfactory at one time. The queue is continuously moving so you will not get bored though the queue is too long as you will get in the mandir very soon.

If you are visiting for the first time, I recommend visiting once in the evening as there are two time slots for the light & sound show. (Not happens during Rainy day and Monsoon)
Light & Sound show starting time: 1) 8:45 pm IST 2) 9:45 pm IST.

Also, you can go to the riverside (maybe called Samudra Darshan) for some good photos. There is a ticket for this (maybe 50  or something -not sure) .

one story said, The original shiv ling was broken into pieces and taken to multiple places around the world. According to history, one piece lies under the steps of a mosque in Afghanistan and the second piece is under the steps of Jama masjid, Delhi. Other story says that the shiv ling in Mecca was the one from Somnath.

Now it is not the Swayambhu (self manifested) Ling. The Pran Pratishtha (ceremony to invite deity to present in idol by way of mantras) ceremony of present Ling was performed in presence of Dr. Rajendra Prasad.
Mughal invaders destroyed the temple numerous times, looted the valuables and broke the Shiv Ling.
In conversation with locals, everyone has a different story to say. Some say that Self manifested Shiv Ling was thrown into the sea. Some say that it was broken and pieces were scattered away.
So the present Ling is not the self manifested Ling. However, the Aura, the Divinity, the Vibrations , the Powers, the Faith remain the same.
The credit for reconstruction of Jyotirling, with which faith of millions of Hindus is associated including me, goes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

About Place: The intricately carved honey-colored Somnath temple on the western edge of the state is believed to be the place where the first of the twelve holy jyotirlingas emerged in India - a spot where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.

Mahmud Ghazni has plundered and destroyed Somnath Temple 17 times along with other temples in his attacks. Mahmud Ghazni was the King of Ghazni (Afghanistan) who ruled there from 999-1030 AD. He plundered a lot many kingdoms and temples of India.

It is said that Shiva manifested there as a blazing column of light.

The temples are situated where the Sarasvati, Hiran, and Kapila rivers converge, and the shoreline where they are built is touched by the ebb and flow of the Arabian Sea.

Although the history of the ancient temple starts in 649 BC, it is thought to be earlier. In 1951, the current shape was rebuilt. Though its difficult to see them through the foggy glass, vibrant dioramas depicting the Shiva narrative border the north side of the temple grounds.

There are legends that the moon deity Somraj initially constructed a gold temple at Somnath, which was then rebuilt in stone by Bhimdev, in wood by Krishna, and in silver by Ravana. On the original beachfront location, the calm, symmetrical edifice that stands today was constructed in accordance with traditional ideas. It has a creamy hue and some exquisite sculpture. One of the 12 most revered Shiva temples, or jyotirlinga, is the enormous, black Shiva lingam in its centre.

It is considered to be the first of the jyotirlingas

It is believed that the original temple was built by the Moon God with gold in the Satya Yuga; by Ravana in Treta Yuga in silver; and by Lord Krishna in Dwapara Yuga in sandalwood.

This temple has been looted and demolished many times by various invaders - by Mahmud of Ghazni (1024), Afzal Khan, Ala-ud-din Khilji's commander (1296), Muzaffar Shah (1375), Mahmud Begada (1451), and later Aurangzeb (1665).

Many rulers reconstructed the temple: Shri Vikramaditya of Ujjaini (about 2500 years ago), the Vallabhi kings (in the period 480-767 CE), Bhimadeva of Anhilawada (in 11th century AD), and Khangara, the king of Junagadh (in 1351 AD) among many others.

It has been reconstructed about 17 times! The modern structure has been constructed by India's former deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel between 1947 and 1951 in sandstone.

Lord Shiva blessed him with good health and removed the Tuberculosis disease cursed by Raja Daksh on him. So, the natives of Taurus Zodiac must worship Somnath Jyotirlinga and visit this shrine. They must also consecrate this Jyotirlinga with Panchamrat( Milk, Gangajal, Honey, Desi Ghee, and Curd).
It is believed to be the first of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of Lord Shiva. For people who believe in the existence of Shiva, this is an important place of pilgrimage for them. It is also one of the most famous tourist attractions in Gujarat.

The scenic beauty of this place is truly captivating. As one of Indias famous twelve jyotirlingas, its incredibly well-organized, making it easy to navigate despite the large crowds of devotees from around the world. I was impressed by the efficient facilities, including a cloakroom with digital lockers and a shoe house, which saved me from waiting in long queues. The temples architecture is simply marvelous. I was able to purchase Ganga jal and even offer it to Lord Shiva Linga through a convenient channel operated by a small pump. I visited with my parents and enjoyed the experience, although we found the food options a bit challenging as non-Gujaratis. However, we discovered affordable and delicious thali houses nearby, offering a wide variety of options for just 60 rupees. The highlight of my visit was strolling along the serene sea shore walkway behind the temple, feeling the cool breeze and taking in the natural beauty. In the evenings, sitting by the sea shore was a truly heavenly experience. After visiting Somnath Temple, Im eager to explore more, particularly the Balka Teerth, where other shivlingas are located within the sea, accessible only during low tide. The journey to Somnath Temple itself was picturesque, with beautiful boats and architectures along the way, making it a truly unforgettable experience.

The first Jyotirlinga and the oldest temple in the country is the Somnath temple in Gujarat. According to Purana, Chandradeva Prajapati married 27 daughters of Daksha Raja, but he was more attracted to one wife/ the remaining 26 wives felt humiliated and the father complained to Daksha Raja. Hearing this, the king got angry and cursed Chandradev that his form and size would diminish day by day. Chandradeva then started worshiping Lord Shiva on the shores of the Arabian Sea, Mahadeva was pleased with his worship and reduced his curse by half at the sight. That is, until the full moon, Chandradev will regain his full form and size, and after the full moon, he will gradually lose weight. Chandradev built a golden Shiva temple at this place. This temple was destroyed 17 times by enemies and then rebuilt by devotees. The temple we see now was renovated by Vallabh Bhai Patel, the Iron Man Sardar of Gujarat. A statue of him is erected in front of the temple. The temple is open from 6 am to 10 pm. The light and sound show starts from 8 pm in the temple premises, except during the rainy season. The history of Somnath is highlighted through the Bhasyapath of Gujarat tourism brand ambasadar Shri Abhithav Bachchan. Details video is given on U Tube.

Vikas thought that something had to be done. He made a plan with his friends. He evacuated the village people to safe places and helped them.

Vikas saw that an old man was trapped in water. He immediately along with his friends saved her.

The village people praised Vikas and his friends a lot. Vikas learned that with hard work and struggle we can solve any problem and helping others gives us happiness.

It is renowned as the first among the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple's grandeur and spiritual significance make it a must-visit destination for devotees and tourists alike.

**Ambience and Architecture:**
The temples architecture is both majestic and intricate, reflecting a blend of traditional Hindu styles. The main sanctum houses the sacred Shiva Lingam, and the overall design is a marvel of ancient craftsmanship. The temple is surrounded by beautiful gardens and overlooks the Arabian Sea, offering breathtaking views and a serene atmosphere.

**Historical Significance:**
Somnath Temple has a rich history and is linked to numerous legends from Hindu mythology. It is famously associated with Lord Shiva and has been rebuilt several times over centuries due to its destruction by various invaders. The temples resilience and its role in Hindu heritage make it a deeply spiritual site.

**Facilities and Accessibility:**

There are also several shops around the temple where visitors can buy religious items and local souvenirs. The site is easily accessible, with good signage and transportation options available.

Whether you are seeking religious solace or simply exploring the cultural heritage of Gujarat, Somnath Temple provides a memorable and meaningful experience.

The complete and detailed information about the attacks on Somnath Temple by Mohammad of Ghazni is as follows:

**A brief history of the invasions of Muhammad of Ghazni:**

1. **First invasion (1000 AD):**
- Mohammad Ghazni started his invasion in 1000 AD. In this attack, he destroyed the main structure of the Somnath temple and looted the wealth and precious objects there. This invasion was a major blow to Hindu religion and culture. Ghaznis army entered the sanctum sanctorum of the temple and also damaged the sacred Shivalinga.

2. **Second invasion (1025 AD):**
- Ghazni once again attacked Somnath in 1025 AD. The objective of this attack was to completely demolish the temple and loot all the property from there. Ghazni this time broke down the walls of the temple and completely looted the jewelery and wealth within the temple. This attack was so terrible that even the possibility of rebuilding the temple diminished.

3. **Third Invasion (1031 AD):**
- According to some sources, Ghazni launched another invasion in 1031 AD. This time the attack was less intense, but its objective was again to damage the temple and loot the remaining property.

**Impact and consequences of the attacks:**
- The invasions of Mohammed of Ghazni became a symbol of religious and cultural conflicts in Indian history. These invasions repeatedly destroyed the Somnath temple and challenged its identity as a symbol of Hinduism. The Ghazni invasions deeply hurt Indian society, but with time, Indian emperors and religious leaders tried to renovate the Somnath temple.

- The reconstruction process of Somnath Temple demonstrated the tenacity and religious tolerance of Indian society. This temple has been renovated several times and is still an important religious site.

The invasions of Mohammed of Ghazni added an important stream of religious conflicts to Indian history, but Indian culture faced these difficulties and retained its cultural and religious heritage.

It is famously associated with Lord Shiva and has been rebuilt several times over centuries due to its destruction by various invaders. The temple's resilience and its role in Hindu heritage make it a deeply spiritual site.


**Facilities and Accessibility:**

The temple is well-equipped with essential facilities including clean restrooms, ample seating areas, and well-marked pathways. There are also several shops around the temple where visitors can buy religious items and local souvenirs. The site is easily accessible, with good signage and transportation options available. However, it can get quite crowded during peak times, so planning your visit early in the day might enhance your experience.


**Overall Experience:**

Visiting Somnath Temple is a profoundly spiritual experience. The combination of its historical significance, impressive architecture, and tranquil coastal setting offers a unique and enriching visit. Whether you are seeking religious solace or simply exploring the cultural heritage of Gujarat, Somnath Temple provides a memorable and meaningful experience.

It is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Hindus and the first of the twelve jyotirlingas of Shiva. It is not clear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE and around the 9th century CE. Ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism do not mention the temple as Somnatha Namkarana, but Prabhas-pattan (Prabhas Patan) as the tirtha (place of pilgrimage), where this temple exists. For example, chapters 109, 118, and 119 of Book 3 (Vana Parva) of the Mahabharata and sections 10.45 and 10.78 of the Bhagavata Purana Rajya Prabhas are shrines on the coast of Saurashtra. The present Somnath temple was rebuilt in the Maru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The reconstruction of the contemporary Somnath temple was started under the orders of Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, after getting approval for the reconstruction from Mahatma Gandhi. Reconstruction was completed in May 1951 after Gandhis death.

It is one of the select and important temples in Indian history and Hindus. Even today it is considered and known as the first Jyotirlinga among the 12 Jyotirlingas of India. Located in the Veraval port of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, this temple is said to have been built by Chandradev himself, the mention of which is clear in the Rigveda. According to folklore, it was here that Lord Krishna died. Due to this the importance of this area increased even more.
This temple has been a symbol of the history of the rise and fall of Hindu religion. Due to being very luxurious, this temple was demolished and rebuilt many times in history. The reconstruction of the present building was started by the Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after Indias independence and on 1 December 1955, the President of India Rajendra Prasad dedicated it to the nation. Somnath Temple is a world famous religious and tourist destination. A one-hour sound and light show runs in the temple premises from 7:30 to 8:30 in the night, in which a very beautiful pictorial description of the history of Somnath Temple is given.
The work of arrangement and operation of Somnathji temple is under the Somnath Trust. The government has made arrangements for income by giving land and gardens to the trust. This pilgrimage is also famous for the Shraddha of ancestors, Narayan Bali etc. The special importance of performing Shraddha in the months of Chaitra, Bhadrapada and Kartik has been explained here. There is a huge crowd of devotees here during these three months. Apart from this, there is a great confluence of three rivers Hiran, Kapila and Saraswati. This Triveni bath has special significance.

The food served in eateries near the temple is mostly vegetarian. The months of January, February and March are the best to visit.

It is said that it was built by Chandradev Somraj himself, whose mention is found in Rigveda.

This temple is located in Veraval port of Gujarat. It is said that the Arab traveler Al Beruni had written its description in his travelogue, which was influenced by the invader Mahmud Ghaznavi who attacked the temple in 1025. Ghaznavi looted the property of the temple and almost destroyed it. Regarding the horror of that attack, it is said that Ghaznavi had attacked the Somnath temple with about 5,000 people. Thousands of unarmed people were killed while protecting the temple. Among them were those people who were either worshiping here or taking advantage of darshan inside the temple. There were also people who lived in the surrounding villages and ran to protect the temple.

The temple was destroyed several times by Mughal rulers and rebuilt by Hindu kings.
The last reconstruction was done by Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar in the 17th century, which is known as the Old Somnath Temple.

The temple that is standing today was rebuilt by Indias Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950. It was dedicated to the nation by the President of India Shankar Dayal Sharma on 1st December 1995.

One of the 12 Jyotirlingas is installed in the world famous temple named Somnath on the sea shore in Kathiawar region of Gujarat state.

The glory of Somnath-Jyotirlinga has been described in detail in Mahabharata, Shrimad Bhagwat and Skanda Purana etc. Moon God also has a name Som. Chandradev had performed penance here considering Lord Shiva as his lord, hence its name became Somnath.

This Jyotirlinga of India is the center of faith of Somnath devotees. There is a mythological belief about Somnath temple that it was built by Chandradev himself. Which is mentioned in Rigveda. The process of rise and fall of this holy temple continued for thousands of years.

After independence, Indias Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had rebuilt this temple with his tireless efforts. On 11 May 1951, the consecration of Shri Somnath Jyotirlinga in this temple was done with much fanfare by the then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasadji. .

The area of   Somnath temple is spread over 10 kilometers. There are about 40 other temples within the limits of this temple. In which idols of Parvati, Lakshmi, Ganga, Saraswati and Nandi are installed. A very beautiful statue of Ahlyeshwar is situated above Shivling. A beautiful and grand statue of Lord Ganesha is installed in the temple courtyard. There is a statue of Aghorlinga outside the north gate. A very beautiful and huge temple of Mahakali and Queen Ahilyabai is also established. Apart from this, the huge beautiful lake named Gaurikund mesmerizes the visitors.

The hymn of the Rig-Veda quoted below mentions the great pilgrimage of Lord Someshwar and Gangaji, Yamunaji and Sarasvati towards the east. This indicates the ancient value of this tirtha.

Prabhas is in Patan which is very close to Somnath Veraval.

It is said that the moon god was freed from the curse of his father-in-law Daksha Prajapati by the blessings of Lord Somnath. In Shiva Purana and Nandi Upapurana, Shiva says, ``I am always everywhere, but especially in 12 forms and places as Jyotirlingas. Somnath is one of these 12 holy places. This is the first of the twelve holy Shiva Jyotirlinga.

The shore temple of Somnath is believed to have been built in 4 phases by Lord Soma, Ravi in   silver, Krishna under the tree in wood and King Bhimadeva in stone.

It has endured six desecrations by Muslim invaders. The presence of this temple is a symbol of the restorative spirit and cultural unity of our society.

The present seventh temple is built in Kailash Mahameru Prasad style. Indias iron man Sardar Sri Vallabhbhai Patel was the pioneer of the present temple.

The temple consists of Garbru, Saphamandap and Nridhyamandap with 150 feet high shikar.

These things about the world famous Somnath temple are unknown

Published By: marisha | I am Gujarat -

Updated: Aug 24, 2017 11:42 am IST

1/1612 First among Jyotirlingas



According to the belief of Hinduism, the twelve places where Lord Shiva manifested Himself are worshiped in the form of Jyotirlinga. Shri Somnath in Gujarats Saurashtra ranks first among them. Shiva devotees from all over the world come here to see the magnificent Shivalinga. But there are lesser known things about Somnath temple in Gujarat which very few devotees know about.

2/16 Last renovated in 1951:



Somnath Temple has been a symbol of the rise and fall of Hinduism in India. The Muslim rulers tried to demolish this temple several times but the Somnath temple is standing again. The temple you see now was renovated between 1947 and 1951 after independence. President of India Dr. It was inaugurated by Rajendra Prasad.

3/16Syamantaka Mani:



It is believed that the Syamantaka Mani is hidden in the cavity of the Shivlinga of Somnath. This gem is associated with Lord Shri Krishna. It is believed that whoever it touches becomes gold. This gem is believed to have radioactive properties. According to the belief, it is because of the magnetic field of this gem that the Shivlinga is standing so high above the ground.

4/16 Fifty thousand people died in the temple:



When Sultan Mahmud came to India, he ended the religious war. He made several attempts to demolish the Somnath temple with the intention of converting the Hindus into Mohammedans. He reached Somnath in December 1025 and the Indians made several attempts to stop him there. Thousands of people rushed to the temple crying for help. He continued to fight the Sultan from the temple till his last breath. According to an estimate, 50 thousand people lost their lives in this war.

5/16 Treasure looted:



After the victory, the Sultan was amazed to see the statues in this temple. He ordered to loot the treasure of this temple. Many of these idols were made of gold and silver. Along with this, countless valuable utensils, ornaments etc. were also looted.

6/16 Idol hanging in the air:



The Sultan was stunned to see the idol hanging in the air in the Somnath temple. The idol was seen floating in the air without any visible support. On investigation, the Sultan found that the idol was made of iron. The craftsman who made it arranged magnets around it in such a way that the idol could be suspended in mid-air. When two stones were removed from the top of the temple, the idol leaned to one side. As more stones were removed, the idol fell on the ground.

7/16 Mention in Veda Purana:



Somnath Temple is mentioned in Veda Purana. This temple located on the western coast of Gujarat is also mentioned in Srimad Bhagavata, Skanda Purana, Shiva Purana, Rig Veda. Somnath is a very big pilgrimage for Hindus.

8/16 Vallabhbhai Patel renovated:



Over the years, many Muslim kings have tried to demolish this temple, but each time Hindu kings have rebuilt it and set the precedent. Finally in November 1947, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel visited the area and decided to renovate the temple. Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi took responsibility for its restoration after Patels death.

9/16Triveni Sangam:



According to historians, there was a confluence of three rivers namely Kapila, Heeran and Saraswati near Somnath in ancient times. It is believed that the moon deity, who had lost his luster due to a curse, regained his form by taking a bath in the river Saraswati here.

10/16 Sometimes the temple was made of gold-silver and sandalwood:



According to the belief, Chandra Dev was happy to get rid of his curse and built a golden temple in Somnath. After that Shiva devotee Ravana built a silver temple in Somnath. It is also mentioned that Dwarkadhish Krishna Bhagwan built this temple with sandal wood during his reign.

11/16 When did Prana Pratistha happen?

A study of the ancient scriptures of India reveals that the Somnath Jyotirlinga was established and the Prana pratishtha was established on the third day of the Shukla Paksha of the month of Shravan in the Treta Yuga.
